Review for Nelson Photo Supplies:
Review 1: Came to SD for a quick day trip from LA until I realized I forgot my film camera. Didnt have the funds to buy a replacement so thought I should buy some disposable cameras. I called the store beforehand to see if they carried the specific one I was looking for but said they didn't and offered a couple of different options. 

Went into the store and all of the staff members were so kind and welcoming. I'm a sucker for small acts of kindness and the lady (forgot her name) working at the front desk was so kind in showing me the different type of disposable camera options for me.

I wish I lived in SD so I can come back here to get my photos developed, but hopefully this review can reach just one more person looking for a photo supply store

Review 2: I usually drive out of my way to come here. The staff are always friendly and eager to help. They have a great variety of products for both digital and film photography. They have a nice section of darkroom and studio equipment, which is really helpful (who wants to buy that stuff online?) They have a lot of obscure film stocks on hand, as well. Some stuff I've never even heard of. 

If you're lucky, the turn-around time on film development can be crazy fast. Obviously, you can't expect that all the time, but I have gone to drop off film on my lunch break and left with my developed film within the hour. I was very impressed. 

Support your local photo shops. You can't buy community online.

Review 3: Love coming here to get my film developed! Usually takes a couple days to a week to get them developed. The staff are always friendly and welcoming! Will definitely be coming back :-)

Review 4: I love Nelson's, been coming here since the mid 90's and the customer service is fantastic. 
I recently bought some new kit and Kate helped me pickout the perfect backpack for my camera gear. I really appreciate that they strive to help their customers find what they need.

Review 5: Gave a call to Nelson to get an estimate of when my order would be completed. I said no worries at all and no rush of course, just wanted to give a call and follow up since I wasn't given an estimate and want to confirm I was set. I'm used to making developing orders in my home town and it was my first time using Nelson, that's why I chose to follow up. The woman who answered the phone was extremely unprofessional and demeaning. She just responded by saying "Well when did we tell you in would be ready." I told her I wasn't given an estimate or maybe it was my bad and I did not hear. She goes "Um for me to look through the 1000 orders we have is just not happening". I didn't even ask when it would be ready by or for a specific day, I just called to "check in on the status or follow up on my order". I respectfully said "No worries at all, thank you" and the woman just hung up. Go to super color imaging for developing your photos if your in the OC area. Kind workers, lower charges, and great quality!

Review 6: Super fast, easy service. It's difficult to find a place to develop disposable cameras with as quick a turnaround time as they have! I came in just after the holidays and they were incredibly busy. I was warned my camera could take a week to develop (which is still faster than anywhere else) but they had it back to me after only a few days! The staff is friendly and accommodating. My pictures were perfect!

Review 7: Recently started going to Nelson's photos to get my film developed, customer service usually is helpful &amp; friendly! This one particular time I had called I was rushing after work to pick up my film. I had called about 10 minutes before closing to see if I was still able to pick up my film and let the staff know I was about five minutes away. I understand with it being so close to closing time it may or may not have been a possibility which was totally fine with me! However, the way this male worker in the film department responded to my concerns was particularly rude and off-putting. I had no issues if I was unable to pick it up that day, I just expected the response to be more professional.

Review 8: They are well stocked. I got what I needed. However, I was taken aback by the customer service. I walked in and it took 20 minutes to even be noticed and acknowledged. I decided to pay attention to the customers that came in after me. They were all cheerfully acknowledged and staff eagerly helped them even before I was helped. Finally someone came to me and asked if I needed anything. I ended up spending about $800, but honestly, if others had what I wanted I would not have patronized this store. Hopefully this is NOT the treatment experienced by everyone who looks like me when they walk through the door. The other customers, however, were immediately noticed and treated well. By the way, there are also many cool discounted finds such as tripod stands and bags. The employee who helped me was knowledgeable and patient and really helped me a lot.

Review 9: I am so thankful for Nelson's photos. Everytime I go, they've always been so nice + helpful. They actually listen to what I'm looking for and point me in the right direction. I usually rent lenses from they to try and they're very reasonably priced and have a great selection. Definitely a neighborhood gem!

Review 10: So helpful!  I'm new to photography and had a lot of questions. They were happy to answer and also give recommendations for other equipment. 
I'll be back!
5

Review 11: I bought a Nikon camera and a Nikkor 500 lens.  Everyone there was kind and helpful at the time of purchase and during subsequent visits.
5

Review 12: Love them!! Wether your a novice photographer or seasoned professional Nelson's excels in everything. They are honest with you and really try to help with any questions you may have. 

Thank have been using them for my classes as well as now I use them for client work. I've bought equipment and photography class supplies( they give students discounts too) - shop local, support small business :)

Review 13: After dropping some film at Nelson's, Jenessa and I wondered why we've never given them a great yelp review because we have nothing but great things to say about this place. The location is not only convenient but the environment is very safe. They have a sanitation station right when you walk in and never let this place crowd up. There is always someone who acknowledges you from the moment you walk in to the second you leave. Drop off is super fast and easy. We never wait longer then a week for our prints and they're always amazing quality!! If Nelson's doesn't have an item you're looking for they are also very kind to point you in the right direction with anything camera related. last but not least, we love the staff!!! 
Every experience here is amazing. 
They are a true San Diego gem and deserve every 5 star review on yelp!!
5

Review 14: I always enjoy stopping by and seeing all the new gear. I recently rented some equipment and was assisted by Paul and Carlo. Great experience and will rent again!
5

Review 15: An iconic store that has survived many decades in San Diego. Nelson Photo has adapted with the changes in the Photographic industry and continues to provide excellent professional level service at reasonable prices.
I rely on Nelson Photo to process and print my color print Film, and to print my digital files.
5

Review 16: I've been going to Nelson for a year now and I can always rely on them to develop my 35mm film in amazing quality. They really try to keep their prices low on film rolls even when big brands like Fuji are raising their prices because they want the best for their customers. Also, they work so hard to develop film in a short amount of time whereas other places can take weeks to do it. A lot of the time, I've been able to get my film developed within the same day. They really care about their customers and the work they put in. Nancy is a great employee!! Wouldn't go to any other photo store!!

Review 17: Great shop and a large selection. Great customer service as well. I was looking for a new lens for my Sony and was able to find what I needed.
5

Review 18: I just stopped in to find out some more information and to get help in deciding between a Sony A7ii or a Sony A6400. I was helped by an very lovely and knowledgeable woman named Catie. After further discussing the options I let her know that I was open to other brands as well and she introduced me to the Olympus E-M1 III. After spending some time with her on this camera I will be doing some more research on this model. Go see Catie! She is great!

Review 19: It's unfair to even compare to other photo labs to Nelson's. While in college I spent time between San Diego and San Francisco. Between the two areas I tried multiple photo labs. The end result was always the same. I would always end up thinking, "Nelson's could of done a better job for a cheaper price with a quicker turn around time." As I return to the Bay Area long term I am sad to say goodbye to the kind folks at Nelson's. If you are looking to develop and scan film, pay them a visit and you will not be disappointed.
5

Review 20: First time going here to develop disposable cameras and some rolls of film, in total I had 7 different things to get developed. Went in right after they opened and was helped right away. I was told it might take until the next day to get my pictures uploaded into my Dropbox, when really I got them 4 hours after dropping off all my stuff! Super quick and everyone was super nice!
5

Review 21: My favorite camera store especially the film department!! Appreciate all the employees being nice and respectful to their customers! This is the only place I would go to buy cameras and film! Would recommend this place for travelers and beginners starting into photography!!
5

Review 22: came to nelsons around 2pm to get my disposable camera developed and i opted to get my pictures scanned to my dropbox. they told me it should be completed by the end if day...within AN HOUR my scans were sent to my dropbox!! fastest service ever! worth the price
5

Review 23: I've been a loyal customer here for years, almost entirely for their film lab services. I'm so glad that places like this still exist in San Diego.

Their prices are very fair for what you get, and the turnaround time is simply unbeatable. Literally unbeatable. I can often times get my negs and scans back same day, and it's only on the really busy days that I have to wait until the next day to come pick them up.

Their scan colorist does a great job. I mostly shoot Portra 400, and my scans (16mb) come back perfectly colored and still with enough leeway for me to make my adjustments in post. 

Customer service is clearly at the core of their ethos. I once had a USB drive fail, causing me to lose the scans that I had just gotten. I called up Nelson's, and they were able to fix it for me by sending me a Google Drive link. 

Always a great experience here. They've got a customer for life.
5

Review 24: I got film developed here and was refunded for half of the cost and not told why. When i looked at it there was no dropbox link that i paid for and of the two rolls of film i sent in to get developed, one of them never came back. 

EDIT: they still havent refunded me the $20 they said they would even after they took my card and swiped it. Very unreliable place and i will not be going back.

Review 25: I have been coming here for years and everyone is always really helpful. I recently went in and Julie couch assisted me. She is one of the most kind and genuine people I've ever had the pleasure of doing business with. She went above and beyond to help me and truly made my Christmas.

Review 26: My absolute favorite camera store in San Diego!  Nelson Photo Supplies has the broadest selection of camera gear and their staff is incredibly helpful.  Great value, outstanding service, very knowledgeable, and everything you could possibly need for photography and videography.  Highly recommended, 5 stars!
5

Review 27: I grew up at this story. My father was a professional photographer. Many nights and weekends were spent picking up or dropping here, searching for the right this or the correct that. One thing I always knew about Nelson's was that they were filled with honest customer service. Until yesterday. You have lost a customer.
1

Review 28: Whether you are a professional or novice photographer, this is your store.   The stellar customer service alone is worth walking in for. I was a customer when they were located on India Street, and now that they are on Midway, I am still a loyal customer. Katie sold me a Nikon D850, suggested an amazing warranty, and when I ended up needing a repair and came in frazzled and uncertain what to do next, found and printed my warranty receipt, then shipped my broken camera from the store- for free!. Not only that, she had my back when I needed a loaner for a wedding shoot I had scheduled, and it was comped because of the repair. Also talked to Tony who said to let them know if I had any other shoots on the books that I would need a loaner for, because he would take care of me. The staff at Nelson's is truly, authentically dedicated to helping you with anything camera related. They are a wealth of knowledge, whether you need technical intel., help adjusting a setting, advice on gear and products, or photography tips. These guys go above and beyond to meet your needs, and then exceed your expectations in the process. If you live anywhere in San Diego, make Nelson's your go-to camera supply place. I am a professional photographer, and will be a lifetime customer!
5

Review 29: These guys are my favorite.  They will answer any of my questions, tell great jokes and will help me find anything I might possibly need.  I also use them for all my photography business printing.
5

Review 30: Nancy is the most helpful awesome lady I've ever met! Came in just to browse around and realized I needed a strap for my hasselblad. Although she was out of stock she called up a few camera stores nearby and found a store that had a strap in stock. They also had cinestill 800t film which is hard to come by. I'll definitely be coming back here again whenever I'm in town!
5

Review 31: This store is a bit of a drive for me but so worth it.  I called ahead of time to talk about trading in some equipment.  The lady that answered was kind and she greeted me at the door when I arrived.  They took the time to talk to me about what I shoot with a genuine interest.  They are my go to store from this point forward.
5

Review 32: Hands down the best customer service everytime I walk in those doors. Ashley is always so helpful and great to talk to!! They're very quick with processing and developing. Thank you guys for always making a genuine connection with your customers! Stay rad
5

Review 33: I am so grateful to have found this shop! I wanted to buy a nice camera and I was afraid my options were going to be the big box shops where the employees probably knew even less than me. A quick Google search lead me to Nelson Photo Supplies. Mary helped me choose a camera. She took the time to explain the differences in cameras without ever being pushy - she was informative. Plus she pointed out the main features, how to get started and common mistakes people make. This place is a treasure!
5

Review 34: This place is awesome! I took my disposable camera in to get the photos developed and it took them less than 24 hours and only cost $12! I've always been told it was a much longer and more expensive process so I'd been putting it off but now I'm inspired to buy more since they make it so easy!
5

Review 35: Big kudos to Catie and her colleagues at Nelson Photo. They are friendly, helpful and knowledgeable! Every interaction I've had with them has been fun and informative. Finally took the plunge and purchased a PEN F after months of saving my pennies. Catie has been patient and helpful throughout the whole process, even managing to arrange a tryout of the camera over the holidays for me. This is why I try to support local businesses--you can't get this kind of personal and pleasant service online. If you're looking for a camera, lens, or all sorts of other photo supplies/services--check out Nelson Photo! No, I don't work for them, I'm just a very happy customer and I'll be back!
5

Review 36: Nelson's was recommended by my photography Facebook group, and I'm glad I made the 40-minute drive!  The staff was warm and helpful.  I went there to have my sensors cleaned, and it turns out that they were able to just blow the dust off of my lens.  They did not charge me when I know that other types of businesses would have just charged and taken advantage of the customer.  I was so impressed with the integrity!  I will be back to take one of the classes offered on site.  They also have a huge selection there!
5

Review 37: What a friendly and helpful store.  They have a great and helpful attitude that made my experience terrific.   Rhank you!

Review 38: I needed to get actor headshots printed on short notice, so I took a chance on Nelson Photo Supplies, which I'd never used before. I couldn't have had a better experience. Their website made ordering easy, and after I called and left a message during non-business hours about the time sensitive nature of my order, an employee called me back right after they opened to answer my questions and verify what I needed. She was friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful, and I got exactly what I needed in under 24 hours, all at a very reasonable price. I'll definitely use Nelson again the next time I need photo prints of any kind. Thanks, Nelson Photo Supplies!

Review 39: My mind is blown. My husband, son and I walked in 5min to 6pm, their closing time. Within 6 min my husband had picked out the microphone he needed and as walking to the register to pay for it he asked the salesman that was helping him if they had mid-tier tripods. Another gentleman spoke up and said "were trying to close". We had $300 worth of items in our hand after 6min. He proceeded to tell us that his people had been there all day. Isn't my sale 3 min after closing going to help keep his employees employed was my thought. We left everything sitting on the counter and walked out. Very unfortunate as we live around the corner and tried to support a local business. We will resort to Amazon.

Review 40: The Nelson Photo website sends me interesting E-mails on a regular basis.  One of which was a notice that KEH, the used camera equipment company based in Georgia, will be setting up shop at Nelson Photo to appraise and purchase used photo equipment.  Yes, even film cameras.

I grudgingly decided it was time for me to part with my beloved Nikon FM2 SLR film camera and several lenses and maybe, just maybe join the digital camera revolution, a few decades late.  I've been using my smartphone in the meantime for photos.  Packing up my Nikon stuff, I came across my Minolta SRT-101 and some lenses.  Talk about a blast from the past!

KEH offered a fair price for my equipment, and I elected to take a Nelson gift certificate which had a 15% spiff compared to a cash out.  Now, I have my eye on a new Canon G7X Mk II and am biding my time for the recurring $100 factory rebate offer.

Other Yelpers have described Nelson Photo as having "small town service", a very good thing.  Born and raised in a small town, I couldn't agree more.

Review 41: Nelson photo helped me pull of a spectacular 80th Birthday celebration!  I found some very old negatives from the 1930s and some slides and film from the 79s in my mom's things. They were able to produce very nice prints from these old items and then scan them for use in a digital display. They provided advice to help us save money where we could with this project and were meticulous in their handling printing the old photographs.
We've found our new photo place now and they've won our family's business.

Review 42: Great service and selection!
So as we walked in we were happy to see a large selection and plenty of staff. And, it was also neat that they were shooting a new product "un-boxing" video in a corner "set" area. 
They have a large selection and a good variety of cameras, lenses, filters, bags, memory, frames and services you'd expect from a solid store. And there was even a photo printing lab on-site. Nice!
They were super excited about their products, they offered us some great options and it was clear they wanted to help us. They even offer discounts for military and emergency services. We felt like we'd like to take the whole store at home! 
We highly recommend this store!

Review 43: Paul the sir with the glasses.
Each time I come to buy new gear "Paul" always tries to up-sale me on stuff I don't want or need for my line of work. When I decline on his offers, he tells me, "I know what you need but you don't let me help you." Yea go figure I need to spend thousands of dollar for your commission, no thanks. 
I fine that a majority of there staffs are condescending.

Review 44: Amazing customer service from Grace and the owners at Nelson Photo Supplies!  You'd think I was in a small town where the friendly folks wanted to help their neighbor.  Instead, these friendly folks wanted to help a stranger!  Would you believe that Grace helped this technically-challenged 74-year-old over the phone to set up slide-scanning on my CanonScan 7000F Mark II  !!  Thank you Grace, Nancy and all owners at Nelson Photo Supplies!  From Grateful Gayle...

Review 45: I stopped by Nelson's looking for a monopod for a very heavy lens. Sales staff helped me find one that was rated for the weight of the eguipment and even had one on sale. The staff asked if this was my first time in the store. I said yes. They asked if I knew about the free classes. I said no. 

I gave them my e mail and I now get updates regarding all their photos classes. Since that first visit I have attended several classes and made numerous purchases. 

Very knowledgeable and friendly staff.
5

Review 46: Excellent customer service. The staff went out of there way to explain each thing and they were so patient, especially Carlo. I thought it was very helpful.
5

Review 47: This place has excellent customer service! The people here are very friendly and go the extra mile to help you out. I went here after my first roll of film wasn't taken care of very well at another shop, had scratches and dust on the scan, one particular photo was important as it was of my wife and her father, so I took the negatives here and they gave them the attention they needed, no scratches or dust in the scans, they even printed out a few 4x6 photos, which they didn't need to do. These guys have will have me as a customer for sure. These guys also have much better parking than Georges Camera
5

Review 48: This company knows how to treat a customer well! This week I brought back a barely used camera that was two years old but was having what I felt were manufacturing defective issues and they agreed- didn't hesitate to make it right- all with cheerful smiles!  Even though they are a 30-40 minute drive way from where I live I will travel back for any camera related needs!
5

Review 49: They are always awesome at Nelson Photo Supplies! I've been a big fan since they were in Little Italy. I stopped going to "the other" rental place many years ago when I had reserved a lens for a wedding and at the last minute, the owner's son (of the other place) gave it to one of his buddies. Never again! So since then I've ONLY been a loyal customer of Nelson Photo! They are the best! They have always delivered what they promised. I once needed a lens for a Saturday, but needed a Friday afternoon pick up. I had finished my shoot at one location and if I had driven straight to them on a Friday afternoon, I would have arrived after closing. The owner, Nancy, said I could call and she'd let me pick up the lens. I'm not promising she'll do the same every Friday for everyone, but that day she was sticking around and that totally helped me get a head start for packing my gear. I was so grateful that I came back and brought them donuts. Sadly she was on vacation that day that I brought it. But maybe next time.
5

Review 50: Nancy is so knowledgeable about binoculars.  If you want a new pair of binoculars go here!  Loved our experience here.
5

Review 51: My new all time local camera supply store! They have extensive knowledge of gear, the industry, film and digital. Everyone there is super friendly. Why order online when you can get one on one attention, great customer service and be able to walk out with your new gear.
5

Review 52: I LOVE Nelson Photo. Whenever I go, all the employees are very friendly and helpful. Nelson is my go-to place to buy my 35mm film and get it developed. I also just bought a Think Tank rolling camera bag here and got a great deal. Support your local photo supply shop!! Go to Nelson!!!
5

Review 53: Was in a pinch during a shoot with a failing battery. They swapped me for a new one in about 5 minutes. Life savers, and super friendly!
5

Review 54: Such wonderful people. I had an issue with my camera and they helped me with a new one right away. They were so kind and insightful about all of their products. Highly recommend!

Review 55: This is the second time I've left a yelp review, and the only time I've ever felt compelled to write something negative. I went here once about a year ago when they still did one hour film processing and everything was fine. Usually I go to a different lab, but I decided to go here again for the convenience and speediness. To start off, the ladies at the film counter were very rude. They didn't understand what I was asking for (my roll developed and scanned to a cd) and acted annoyed when I tried to explain. They kept ringing me up for other things. No one seemed to understand anything about film at all. 

I got a call about an hour after I dropped my film off saying that they developed my black and white roll using color process. The roll is ruined. I have been filling this roll up for the past four months. I have some shots from a best friends wedding among other memories. I went here because the reviews say they are reliable. I understand that film is not as reliable as digital, but I am most upset that the ladies working at the store were not apologetic at all, and had an attitude about the whole thing. The original girl who processed it wrong would not make eye contact and all they offered me was one roll of film to compensate. Do not come here if you have anything important on your rolls. These people are not knowledgeable at all, and should at the very least train their employees better. I will not come here again. I am extremely upset that I am out months of photos, the couple of hours of time spend coming here and waiting and all I have to compensate is one measly roll of film.

EDIT: I never received my refund either. So I'm out $10 as well. Honestly, this place is terrible.

Review 56: Came into Nelson photo to check out the Lumix G85.  I had bought several cameras, etc. at the Little Italy location.  Tony answered all my questions and was a great help.....yes I bought the G85.  Old age, vision problems, and an injured shoulder stopped me from carrying my Nikon everywhere.  Taking photographs is fun again, like using the Olympus Pen EE in Viet Nam or the Kodak ( yes Kodak ) Z740 in Africa, could put in AA batts where there was no electricity.  Still learning, but have already taken $$ pictures.  For your photo needs go to Nelson.
5

Review 57: Was in the market for a new camera and just knew (through their past print advertising) that I needed to go there instead of a big box store that has novices behind the counter.  I worked with Jorge (aka George) and not only was he knowledgeable and friendly he helped me pick the perfect camera for my needs!  Give George a call!
5

Review 58: I've been shooting film for years now. I've gotten scans from at least 40-50 different labs around the world, and occasionally process and scan at home if I have time. For some reason, Nelson's scan quality has beat every other lab I've worked with. The colors and sharpness of the scans they provide me are consistent every time. Someone behind the counter is paying attention to all the details. Also,  their turnaround is impeccable. Heavily suggest going here if you need processing and scans for C41 color film in San Diego.
5

Review 59: Everyone here is awesome, they do great work with prints in a quick timeframe and always answer any questions or concerns you have with cameras or prints or related issues. 
Highly recommended for all your photo and print needs!
5

Review 60: I am a hobbyist photographer. This is my first time to visit in this store, they have the cleaniest set up ever. Some camera store are tight and crowded but this one is nice and clean and makes me comfortable, the staffs are really nice. I can see that they love their jobs. I am very happy I found this place. Will sure returning to this store.
5

Review 61: YOU CAN'T GET THIS KIND OF SERVICE &amp; KNOWLEDGE FROM GOOGLE. With all of the employees being professional photographers/videographers, you know you're getting accurate information and expertise. Even though you think they're "sales people" that want to take your money, Nelson Photo has actually SAVED me over $3,000 in equipment costs. I'll always buy from them because it's a local, family run business that truly cares about getting you the best gear for your needs. Roy and George are especially friendly and helpful. Their prices are the same or lower than online, so buy from them because you'll get all your questions answered and wonderful service!!!
5

Review 62: I can't say enough about how great this place is. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and personable. I was made aware of Nelson's from my photography teacher over a decade ago and will continue to be a returning customer. I've come here for photo supplies as well as camera/lens rentals and have yet to be disappointed by their products or service.
5

Review 63: This place was great in in helping me troubleshoot a broken old camera I found, and since it didn't work, I bought a used one camera from them. Paul taught me how to work it since I have never used a film camera before. Would highly recommend going to them for anything. I'll definitely be back for film rolls and such.
5

Review 64: This is a great store. They stand behind what they sell and deal with it if there is a problem. Roy knows all there is to know about Panasonic cameras. It's great to deal with real local people instead of a faceless computer, and prices are about the same as online stores, but with the real value of personal service.
5

Review 65: Will never go anywhere else to develop photos, they have the best quality around with amazing people who work there. Everyone is very knowledgeable and will help you with any questions you have. Not to mention how sweet everyone is, thanks for being the besttttttt.
5

Review 66: I'm a professional photographer and I traveled to San Diego for a job. I needed a speed lite and found this place on yelp. I had called a few other places and they either didn't rent speedlites or wanted to charge an arm and a leg. 

The staff here were Amazing. So friendly and kind. I wish we had a Nelson's Photo Supplies in Louisiana!
5

Review 67: I stopped by Nelson photo to check out some new lenses for my Sony A6500. I'm a big fan of supporting local businesses. Tony approached me and was extremely kind and helpful to let me test out used lenses. He really looks out for students and understands our budgets. He is very knowledgeable and offers useful suggestions that work best with your style and skill level. I know that I have the best quality lens and at an affordable price! I bought a used (brand new condition) Zeiss lens 1.8/32 for $500 which on Amazon was new for $720. I saved $220! Thanks for the help, Tony! I would definitely recommend anyone to choose Nelson for their awesome customer service and products.
5

Review 68: I came back to Nelson Photo for more color film development.  I mentioned the discrepancy in file size and image quality, and the staff member apologized for the mistake.  I received a discount on my next batch, and the files this time were appropriately sized.  I think it was a one time mistake, honestly admitted to and remedied with a discount.  I have no reason not to return here for further film work!  Thanks Nelson Photo.
5

Review 69: Been a couple years since I ordered prints from their old location in Little Italy. So glad that I had the chance to reacquaint and order prints from Nelson's for holiday gifts. They nail it every time. Prints look tremendous and the customer service is top notch. Ordered oversized prints hours before they closed for Christmas and they were able to get them done! Thanks guys, you rock!
5

Review 70: Been dealing with Nelson since the sixties and have never been disappointed.  Parking is a lot easier at their Midway store and the service is better than ever
5

Review 71: The owners stayed open for me so I could pick something up! Very awesome! Highly recommend using Nelson for your camera needs

Review 72: I needed some photos printed for a Christmas gift with in a couple days. The staff at Nelson Photo were amazingly helpful, knowledgeable and kind. During this busy time of year, they took their time to help me and make sure that I was happy and satisfied with my photo order. The quality of the photos is fantastic and the prices are very reasonable. They have a customer for life.

Review 73: Horrible customer service.  I think the employee's name was Steve.  I had never been treated so disrespectfully in a retail store as I was today.  I was trying to return a shutter release that broke after one use. When I was about to get my money back I asked the employee if they had another shutter release for my camera and he said "it's easier to say  no". I asked again if they had one or not but by that time his response was "all of this for $22.00", threw my money in the counter and walked away.  I was stunned. My first and last purchase there.  Steve keep boasting that he's worked there 21 years and maybe he needs to retire - it was a very upsetting experience.

Review 74: best prices and customer service i've ever experienced in any camera store. i come here regularly to get my film developed and always get great results.

Review 75: These guys do an outstanding job with customer service, not to mention their extensive knowledge of cameras/camera equipment. Have been coming here for a while now and I'm always very pleased with the service and personal attention. Something you'll never experience with an online camera store, no matter how good the online deals are. You can't even really compare the two. Thanks Nelson Photo for providing San Diego residents with a solid camera shop and for going above and beyond to satisfy your customers!

Review 77: I stopped by Nelson's twice, and although I can't quite remember whether I dealt with the same gentleman both times, I for sure got out of the store feeling stupid both times. 

First time, I walked in to check out Nikon full frames they had for sale. I made the -terrible- mistake of asking whether they ever got d750s (which at the time had only been out for 6 months), and the person straight up laughed at my face and said I was dreaming if I thought I could get my hand on a used one. Don't mind me asking I guess... 
I went back after a couple months, looking to sell or trade a lens I had no use for anymore. This time, the person over the counter told me the following: "If everyone went in to sell their lenses, we'd run out of business real quick. We don't really care about buying lenses, we care about making money out of selling them." Fair enough, sounds like the definition of business to me, yet very unprofessional to say to a potential customer. 
I get it, I'm not quite the demographic you usually work with (a 25yo female on a budget but with a passion for photography), but that doesn't mean that I shouldn't be taken seriously. 
To be fair, a lot of people I know have had great experiences with them, and I'm not denying their knowledge and reputation in the field, but I personally will not be back.

Review 78: Top shelf service from Tony and the rest of the crew! They are so helpful, they are their to help you save money and still capture the right shot, you don't how? They will help you/show you! Great prices, especially the rental department, saves much mulla for a one woman photography studio like me! They care about you, truly! I was at home sick Monday and could not return the flash by the end of day and called today, Tony was very helpful and understanding, gave me another day rental at no charge! Two Yacht shoots tonight at sunset, thanks for all you have done to help me Tony!

Review 79: Highly recommend this place! They're all super nice people, they have great prices, and they can get your film uploaded to you in around 2 hours after receiving your film!

Review 80: Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Large selection. Reasonable prices. My first time in, but I will definitely be back to buy more toys.

Review 81: I have bought things here over the last ten or so years here and when they used to be on India St.  At their current location parking is way better than the India St shop they used to have.  They have a pretty big selection of many of the big camera brands like Nikon, Olympus, Fuji, and Sony.  They also have some used equipment.  Lots of added stuff like camera cases, straps, film, tripods and so on.  Very nice friendly people.  

They also have a developing area for film.  They develop color negative film (C-41).  They will develop and scan for around $12.95.  I have been sending my film out to North Coast Photo Services and The Darkroom by mail.  Both of those places are either in North San Diego County or The Darkroom in Southern Orange County, so longer drives by far than Nelson.  Here is the problem, for the $12.95 I was supposed to get and paid for the finer (enhanced) scans.  They were supposed to be about 3,000 pixels across.  I picked up my film and CD the next day drove home and guess what.  The scans were only 1,500 pixels across and were in the 1 mega pixel to 1.5 megapixel size range.  I was using files this size back in 2001.  This is way too small for any use other than preview.  From North Coast when I pay for their enhanced scan I get files 5,000 pixels across and about 12-17 megapixels in size.  This size file is big enough for almost any use.  Cost, around 18 bucks plus shipping.  The Darkroom when you get the enhanced scans gives you back 6,700 pixel wide scans and a whopping 25-32 mega pixel files.  Of course to use this many pixels you need to use a very high grade of film with fine grain like Ektar, Velvia, Portra, and so on.  The Darkroom gives you mailers so you don't pay for sending in your files but you do to send them back.  The Darkroom also stores your files in full size on line and you can access them most of the time.  When their web site is working.  They also send you disks.  North Coast sends you disks.  North Coast is fast.  The Darkroom can take a week, so not fast.  

I am sure if I hassled Nelson they would fix their mistake, but the photos were test shots and I can tell what I need to know from their tiny scans.  And I don't need to drive back to their shop.  If I was only rating Nelson on developing they would have received 2 stars from me.  But since they have been good in other areas in the past I am going with 3 stars.

Review 82: I went to this store a few months ago. They definitely have a nice selection of camera gear for sale. Good sized store and everyone was friendly. I asked a few stupid questions and to the English lady and she seemed a bit irritated w/ me l but I must say she was very knowledgeable about photography equipment. Everyone that worked there was actually very helpful overall. 
The only thing is this,  i understand all the perks of buying something from a retail store, but the item I was looking at they were asking $50 for and I can find it on EBay from a US seller and they accept returns as well for literally 40% less. I would love to support local business and I understand overhead and people's salaries but when I only have X amount of money to spend on an item, and I can only afford it online.... guess where I will buy it?? 
Overall great store and a lot of knowledgeable people.

Review 83: The staff here is absolutely amazing! They have very reasonable prices and their printing services are impeccable. I will not get prints anywhere else! Y'all are great!

Review 84: Wish I had stopped here first!  

I recently purchased a pair of very expensive binoculars, but the carrying case, plastic lens covers, and neck strap that came from the factory were all terrible designs.  Hence, I went on a lengthy search for third-party replacements for the manufacturer's carrying case, lens covers, and neck strap.

Entering Nelson Photo Supplies, located next to the Von's on Midway Drive, I was surprised at how large and well stocked the photo store was considering its small storefront.  There were many customers, but an equal number of sales people, so there was no waiting.  Fortunately, I was greeted by the owner (Nancy) who quickly understood my binocular dilemma and hurried off to find a choice &amp; variety of products that would meet all my needs.  Within minutes, the fit and quality of the three products I purchased, truly exceeded my expectations based on the limited offerings I had seen to date.  Nancy knows her products well and offered me exceptional customer service.  Thank you.  I'll be back!

Review 85: I just recently started dabbling in film after inheriting a Pentax ZX-5N that hadn't been used in decades so, naturally, I was nervous about how my exposures would come out. After hearing my first roll rewind, I was eager to take it in to be processed, but I didn't know where to go. There are obviously a slim number of places that still develop film, but it didn't take too long to find a place thanks to Yelp! 

Most places I found either closed early or weren't open on weekends, but luckily Nelson's was open on weekends! It's pretty far from where I live, but I think it was well worth the trip. I took one 35mm roll of Kodak film in on Sunday around 2:00pm, and had them processed, printed, and scanned onto a disc by 3:15! The fast turnaround time was a huge plus. I was so pleased with the way my photos turned out. The colors were lovely, even the ones I shot in low light, and I absolutely loved the matte finish. Processing, prints &amp; scans totaled to a little more than $13. I'm not sure how that ranks against other places. The staff was happy to answer any questions I had, so don't fret if you're a film dilettante like myself! I'm giving this four stars only because this is the first shop I've been to so I don't have anything else to compare it to. Otherwise, I see nothing wrong with Nelson's and I would recommend them without hesitation.

Review 86: If there was a 10 star option I would have chose it. I was in town for the weekend with family. On our trip we went to San Diego Zoo the day before where I had realized quick that my lens selection was holding me back from taking the imagines that I was shooting for. I stopped into Nelsons the day after to check out some telephoto lenses before we headed to sea world so I wasn't running into the same issue as the day before. I met George that morning who was more then helpful. I told George what my future plans were as far as investing into a newer body. I currently shoot with a Canon T6 and plan on jumping up to a 6d or 6d mkII. When I came into the shop I was looking for something that wasn't going to break the bank so I planned on picking up a STM series lens. Once I informed George that I was planning on purchasing a new body in the future he told me up front that my STM collection of lens will not work on the body I was looking to get he directed me towards the USM lenses which are compatible with both camera bodies. He made me an outstanding deal on a very well kept used EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM lens that I could not refuse. I also picked up a new strap that he had recommended since I wasn't happy with the Canon one the camera came with. I left Nelsons extremely happy. I couldn't believe how helpful all the staff was and George's willingness to answer any and all of my questions. I will be staying in contact with this store in the future for more of my camera needs even though I live out of state. I would highly recommend this store to any photographer of any level of experience. Thanks again, Nelson's staff!!!

Review 87: Nelson has always been a go to store for me. I buy all of my film from them and develop my color film with them every time. Prices are all very reasonable and they sometimes even throw out. As a student they definitely understood how expensive all the supplies could get so they did help me out with that. Staff is super knowledgeable, friendly, and honest, especially Tony!

Review 88: I came in here to see if they had something similar to my tripod support stand with a 1/4 inch connector or possibly another type of screw that I could use to fix the one I had bought. The customer service employee I had interacted seemed a bit annoyed to have to help me. He said that he doubted that he had anything that would work with it and then proceeded to mangle and disassemble my tripod stand that I brought in to check why it was broken and didn't bother putting it back together. Came in with a tripod base in one piece and left with 4 pieces of a stand. 

When I asked him if he had anything else that would be similar to what I brought in he said sorry we don't. So I walked away and looked at the monopods where they in fact had bases that would've definitely worked with my gimbal. He then wandered off and proceeded to talk on the phone to someone about getting a loan for a new house and explained to them why he had bad credit due to his divorce. 

Seems like his personal life is intruding in the way he interacts with the customers here at this store. Don't think i'll be returning here to purchase my camera equipment. Probably be better off buying online off amazon because i don't want to deal with such horrible customer service again.

Review 89: Paul is the man!!

Came in for a few items and he filled our experience with help and humor..

This store has everything you need for making videos and a very pleasant staff..

We will definitely be back in the near future!!

Review 90: I'm not a serious photographer, but I think it would be hard to find a camera store with more honest, pleasant and knowledgeable staff.  Price of the camera was less than Amazon or B&amp;H.
5

Review 91: Stopped in the store this past Sunday and was greeted upon entry. The staff was so personable, fun and very knowledgeable. I walked in knowing what I wanted and it was great to have a conversation with the staff and receive some great tips for my photo needs. You can tell that they have a passion for the photography and it is shared in how they interact with you. Awesome service!

Review 92: Julie and Jorge helped me. They were incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. They helped me pick out the equipment I needed with no annoying up-selling. They worked with my budget and I couldn't have had a better experience.
5

Review 93: Spent $700+ on a Cannon Rebel T6 kit, with 2 lenses, case, and everything else I needed. It was a GREAT deal according to other camera pros. I went to a harsh environment for a while, and unfortunately the battery died when I came back. I returned to the shop, and they took care of the issue with no fuss. 

Staff is very helpful, when you walk in the door a representative will ask if you need help almost immediately. They are all very knowledgeable, and if they cannot answer your question, they will find someone who can.

I will always buy my camera supplies from Nelson Photo. Shout out to representative Paul for helping me now 3 times! He is personable, respectful, and quite the character.

Review 94: I've been using Nelson Photo for years. They are awesome! Great customer service, reasonable prices and excellent quality prints.

Review 95: Wow! Had purchased a mic from them that went bad.  Wasn't even going to take it back because I didn't have the box and figured it was out of warranty. I went in figuring I would have to buy a new one but left 10 mins later w a brand new free replacement. They have the best prices too! Thanks for the great customer service.

Review 96: *This review is for the film printing department*

I came here today because George's camera is closed on sundays and today was my only day off to run errands.

Even though this location is a little bit out of the way for me (i live by Sfsu), the service was exceptional and I am glad I chose to do business with nelsons camera. 

I dropped off 5 rolls of film. They were all old and questionable rolls. The negatives were ready within two hours and a staff member (didn't get her name) went through the negatives with me to determine which would be best to print to help me save money. I really appreciate the help and taking the time to look at the photos with me.

I'll be coming back Thursday to get my prints and will choose to develop the rest of my film endeavors with them.

Thank you for your help today!

Review 97: I stopped in the other day to purchase my first camera and George was more than helpful. He was super knowledgeable, asked all the right questions, and gave me honest answers based on what I needed. He even offered a beginners photography course free of charge with my purchase. Will definitely continue to come here!

Review 98: Printed some 4x6 photos. It felt like it was free. Amazing customer service. Easy to use website.
5

Review 99: Went in looking for a specific piece of equipment that isn't usually sold. They kindly searched through a "junk drawer" for me and had exactly what I needed. Didn't charge me. I look forward to coming back soon to actually purchase something!! Great customer service here, check them out.

Review 100: I found this photography supply store online and the service I've received has been absolutely incredible. I was in between buying my products and supplies online, but I am so glad I didn't. They have been the most helpful, especially since I didn't know how to take one professional photo and my upcoming business requires that I learn this. George has been my go-to and my pictures have turned out amazing. Tony has also been very kind and helpful. They both have given me a mini crash course and I am so grateful I purchased my products and supplies there. Thank you.

Review 101: I spent a very informative and helpful half hour with Tony Amat the other day learning about mirrorless interchangeable lens camera (MILCs).  I'd spent some time reading about these things on-line, but nothing replaces being able to hold, fiddle with, and look through the actual device.  And only a brick-mortar store like Nelson's can let you do that before you commit serious coinage.  Sadly, there aren't many of them left in these days of Amazon and Adorama.

We weren't able to make it back in before had to return to Oregon.  But when we get ready to make the switch from DSLR to MILC, we'll be ordering online from Nelson.

BTW, great new location.  Nostalgia-wise I always liked the old, old Little Italy store.  But being able to drive up and park without spending a half hour looking for a space is a big improvement.

Review 102: I used to go to this place when it was in Banker's Hill. I popped in here today to get some passport photos printed out. The first batch was not quite to my liking so I asked to have them reprinted with a color adjustment. The gal there, named Ashley, was very accommodating and helpful to my needs, as we ended up trying several adjustments till it came out just right. I appreciate her patience in working with me and she exemplified excellent customer service. I'll definitely go back her for any printing needs. Thanks Ashley!

Review 103: I wanted to make the jump from the Nikon D5300 (crop sensor) to the full-frame, professional level (much more expensive) Nikon D810. I'm not a rich man, and have yet to be paid for my photos, so this was no easy decision. Online, I found the camera body on the "grey market" (Amazon/eBay) for a bit above the $2k range, but it was the "international" version, meaning no warranty and also, for the life of the unit, neither Nikon nor any authorized dealer would ever touch it if anything went wrong. As well, upon researching the online sellers, I found either no reviews, or mostly unfavorable ones. Nelson's was selling the unit for around $700 more -- the exact same price as Best Buy listed it. I was really on the fence about this, but Tony, Ben, and Larry were all so honest and patient with me, I decided to go against my usual inclination to buy cheapest, or from a generic box store, and instead buy local. I also picked up a couple killer lenses.

When I got home, I gingerly unwrapped my new machine as well as the new memory card I got with it. I inserted the card and powered up the camera, but upon snapping my first photo, I received an error. Then, to my dismay, the camera would no longer power on with the memory card in! Upon further inspection, I realized that one of the many little copper pins inside the card slot was lilted over. I didn't think this could be my fault, as the card and camera were fresh out of the box, and there is only one way to insert the card, but thought it could be, since I had no experience with this camera style or card format.  I needed this camera for a shoot Sunday morning, as well as another this week, and was worried I would be stuck mailing it away for a long time. Crestfallen, I returned to Nelson's the following day (this past Saturday), where luckily, there happened to be a promotional event happening with Nikon representative on hand.

After a brief examination, Nelson's staff and the friendly Nikon rep on hand told me that while "90% of the time, this problem is pilot error, clearly this time it is not." They were out of stock on this camera body, but immediately ordered me up a new one and offered me their almost-new D810 rental in the meantime. Having already completed the sale, they very well could have brushed me off and told me to email Nikon support. This would have sucked, since I dumped all my money into this unit and could have been without camera and money for a long time.

I'm not sure this review accurately describes how grateful I am to Nelson's, as well as how lucky I feel to have dodged the bullet of avoiding the allure of the cheaper grey market. Less than a month ago, I had never been to Nelson's; I only went in there to browse, and get a better idea of what I would order from the grey market. However, they were so cool/calm, and fielded all of my questions, appreciating and assuaging my fears of being duped. I trusted in them and know it paid off. I haven't yet received my new camera (it's only been a couple of days), but still have the loaner, which worked perfectly for my shoot this past weekend (and which Larry just trusted me to hold on to without even leaving a deposit!). Without that loaner, I would have either missed the shoot, or just been relegated to my old D5300, which takes a nice photo, but is not on the same level.

After my first visit to Nelson's a few weeks ago, on my way out the door, sales rep Tony said to me "This is now your camera store," and he's right. They didn't hook me up with any exotic deals and they didn't make any promises they couldn't keep. I decided to pay a small premium over the grey market for honest, high-quality service and a guarantee which, whilst investing in equipment I probably couldn't really afford, is value I couldn't afford *not* to include. The grey market will always be there, and in many cases, I will still choose that path. In this instance, had this happened with a grey market camera, I certainly would have been screwed. Who knows what misery Best Buy would have put me through.

I will still shop at Walmart, and I'll still buy little things on eBay from China, but if I need anything else for my DSLR, I'm coming back here.

Review 104: As I visited Nelsons new location, ample
Parking, more Spacious, organized and friendly service.

I love the friendly atmosphere here where people know you and you feel treated like a family.

I have been using Nelsons services and buying cameras here since 2001 when I was getting black and white prints.  Pricing for black and white is competitive.

Cameras, they know their gear here.  I have been purchasing my Nikon gear here through Paul who is helpful and straightforward. 

The last time I came which was the first time for me at new location, I was greeted by the owner with a nice smile.

I headed to the counter for questions and help on my flash and was waiting for Corey who took 15 minutes with another client.  I was patient, I get when businesses get busy because local and loyal customers come here for the relationship one has built over the years.  I did not get to speak with Corey, thou Jorge a new and friendly face assisted me.  He was a rock star and was patient and figured out why my camera was not syncing to my flash.  Solution was found and I was thrilled.

For professionals or hobbyists, This is the place to go.  When you purchase a new camera, they have complimentary classes to learn more about your camera and get on their email list to learn about photography workshops being held or upcoming sales.

Enjoy as there are lots of candy.

Review 105: I was referred to this store by a friend so I checked it out. It's a nice store with a great selection of gear, however I chose to go elsewhere. I am absolutely not comfortable with the return policy. They charge a 25% restocking fee for cameras (25%!!!!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME???), 20% restocking fee for lighting and 10% restocking fee for lenses? I've bought 3 cameras, 6 flashes, and 15 lenses over the past 5 years and never had to return one yet, but that's not a policy I'm comfortable with in the event something goes wrong. This is why I buy all my clothes from Nordstrom. I've only ever returned 1 item to Nordstrom, but I keep shopping there because of the return policy, I know if anything ever goes wrong, I'm covered.
2

Review 106: I've been coming back here again and again. I'm from Los Angeles, so that says something. I mainly come down here for the film developing. In LA, developing plus scanning can run up to $13 per roll. At nelson's, it's about $6. I had about 25 rolls from over the years that I needed developed. The scans looked great. Super friendly and helpful staff. Us film shooters are still around! I'm glad they acknowledge that, haha. If you want a camera store to go back to multiple times and not be disappointed, this is the place.
5

Review 107: film developing I do not recommend.  required a deposit to develop 6 rolls of film.  i understand the need for a deposit; however, when i went to pick the film up the manager of the film department was "clueless" that a deposit was required and conveniently could not find a receipt or documents to that effect.  so customer had to retrieve the receipt and when I called to find out what the amount I owed was she claimed it was more.  simple subtraction showed she was overcharging me $8.  i am of the impression this is a means to create confusion for the customer who does not bring in the receipt to pick up film (they don't tell you that you need it) and overcharge them.

Review 108: Very efficient film developing! Had a wide selection of film rolls, and the employees were very helpful and kind.
5

Review 109: Exceptional customer service from experts who don't mind explaining things to non-experts. Ben took the time to answer all my questions with thoroughness, accuracy and courtesy. So rare to find a retailer who still provides this kind of customer service, with no pressure sales tactics. Great new location too.
5

Review 110: Nelson Photo is the best for all your camera needs. They have everything from printing photos in an hour to Camera Rentals!! They know me by name which says a lot. They've been in business for over 60 years. It's the only place I go for anything related to photography. I took a class there this morning and the instructor was awesome. Thank you Corey! And thank you Nancy for always making me feel so good when I come to your store. You guys are the best. The new location is fantastic. Easy parking and easy to get to. Don't know what I'd do without you guys. Thanks for being there for me! I'm not a pro but that doesn't matter. You treat everyone with the same respect.
5

Review 111: The people here are great!  I get all my equipment here and get all the time I need for teaching and questions.   Way better than online support. The classes are very informative and always add more to my knowledge and understanding.  I love having them here when I begin a new area of photography (sporting events, photographing my scrapbooks for back up, zoo photos).  They can never help too much. Try them out.
5

Review 112: New location with lots of parking. Easy access from freeways. Great staff! Everything photo related is right here. So happy!!
5

Review 113: Ok this was one of the best shopping experiences I have ever had. I started off not knowing a whole lot about cameras and only what style I wanted. Ben talked me through every single question I had, every model I inquired about, and every last accessory I pondered over. The mark of a true salesman is someone who can educate the customer to the point where the customer knows they are getting a good deal; not thinks they are getting a good deal. Ben was extremely professional and personable. Prices were better than most of the major electronics stores in the area and again it is nice to have someone as well versed in cameras as Ben is, not the kid right out of high school with a blue polo. Even though I knew very little about cameras, Ben always seemed to be very patient and actually happy to work there. Despite being surrounded by thousand dollar professional lenses, cameras, and accessories; I never felt like my $1000 purchase was insignificant or not worthy of their time. 

I will be a returning customer for sure.

Review 114: It's so hard to find film developing places today, especially locations where you don't have to mail out your film and wait up to a week or more. Nelson Photo is great, they offer same day developing and give back your negatives and can put your photos on a CD. They are reasonably priced and their customer service is great. Everyone there is super nice. I don't live in San Diego anymore but visit often so I plan to hold on to my film and get it developed at Nelson because the price and quality are great!

Review 115: Nelson photo shop is the hallmark store in San Diego for wonderful cameras and all needed equipment. Well stocked with convenient hours, it is my favorite camera store hands down I appreciate how fully staffed they are at all times so I get personal professional attention every time. I have had beatific photo prints done her  I have purchased 1 camera 3 camera lens and numerous filters and travel bags - oh yes and a photo printer.  Competitive prices - no need to shop on line. 5 Stars all the way

Review 116: Great selection and service! Julie took care of me and my friend, she was very knowledgeable, friendly and engaging! I have 20 years in customer service and seldom do I find someone who not only is as good as her but that truly likes dealing with customers... For any photographic need , go nowhere else!!!
5

Review 117: I haven't bought a new camera in 12 years.  Going on vacation and needed a good point and shoot.  This is a great place to buy your camera.  They are extremely knowledgeable, great to work with and put up with me, which is by far saying alot (I can be difficult).  I bought the new panasonic and will have a free class with the purchase of the camera so I will know how to work it when I go on one of those vacations of a lifetime - i am finally going to Italy.  Great pictures here I come.

Review 118: I just left Nelson Photo Supplies Store and could not be happier and more confident! The Satff was helpful and attentive...and helped me pick out the most appropriate camera for my young daughter. They put it all together with the memory chip , added the date and time on it and put in batteries and the case. This location has tons of parking and is spacious!
I also had help with my Christmas cards one year . The cropped it just how I wanted it and it was ready in great time!
Thank you!!

Review 119: They give military discounts! Super friendly even though I only bought one small item.
5

Review 120: Love the new location, so much easier to park!
5

Review 121: I've been coming here since I was a little baby taking photography courses in college, and I can't believe I've never reviewed them. Everyone here is SO helpful, knowledgeable, honest (! This is a biggie - and if they can't help you, they'll refer you to someone who can) and personable. Quick and easy rental process, the prices per day are reasonable and they have great weekly rental rates. As sad as I was to see them move out of Little Italy, their new location is just as spacious and has parking! 

The owners Larry and Nancy are so kind and they will always have my business. I have to give special props to Julie. She has never once forgot my name, even after some time of not coming in and I always look forward to seeing her when I walk through the doors. She's really knowledgeable and knows what she's talking about, I feel like I can always trust what she says. 

Great people! I always leave the store feeling like I'm saying bye to friends. I'm a Nelson's lifer.

Review 122: I LOVE Nelson Photo. Wonderful people, wonderful store with an amazing selection for beginning amateurs and professionals alike. TOP NOTCH service and advice you can't get online. The new location is great too, with ample parking.

Review 123: First time in Nelsons, shop has everything you could ask for. Unfortunately I got lame customer service and payed $50 for a sensor cleaning that was done in a rush before his lunch. Good place to buy but I wouldn't ask for help. Going back in soon with visible proof of the dirty sensor and hopefully they do it well this time. Far drive for sub-par service.

Review 124: Honest &amp; Helpful.  I went to Nelsons to upgrade my dslr after researching by internet.  The man asked me what I was photographing and other relevant questions. After reviewing my needs &amp; knowing what dslr I had, his suggestion was I keep my camera &amp; lens for now but buy a small low cost item so I could get better sunset photos.  (I don't take videos or shoot sports).  He told me to return later &amp; they would give me a lesson how to better utilize my camera. (my battery was dead so they couldn't do it then.)  

My private free lesson included a review of the functions, how to work the light meter along with me taking photos of a tree at different settings.  First of all, thank you.   Secondly, if you want to buy a camera, lens  or equipment, go to Nelsons in the Vons shopping center on Midway.

Review 125: Amazing first experience!! Helpful staff for non-experienced photographers and for those getting started! The customer service here blows George's out of thew water. The new location has plenty of parking and a wide selection as well.

Review 126: I came to Nelson's Photo after being recommended from a a friend. I needed to get 35mm photos processed and my previous go-to spot to have the service done was at Costco (which no longer processes 35mm film). I chose the option of processing the negatives first then choosing which of the photos to print out on 4x6 prints after reviewing them. 

Upon reviewing and expecting the processed negatives, Grace helped me out and ensured that the whole process was going smoothly. She took the time with me to review my rolls and was super helpful. I had some rolls of film that had light damage/leakage and she recommended I take in my camera into the shop to have it looked at by one of the staffers. Amazing Custer service and quality work! Thanks again GRACE !

Review 127: I've come to this shop for prints, for a new camera and a lens. Everyone in this store is extremely helpful and knowledgeable. Anytime I have had any issue with any of my equipment that I have purchased from them, they have gone above and beyond to rectify the situation. Since I am a Nikon guy, I can only speak for those prices, but they have the same prices for Nikon gear as the big box electronic stores and online. It is completely worth it to buy your gear at a local shop who is as helpful and as knowledgeable as they are.
5

Review 128: Came in for a simple battery, 6v for a vintage canon ae-1. Hard to find in regular stores. The lady who helped me was so sweet, she put the battery in for me AND helped me put in my film which I hadn't actually purchased from her particular store. She went over how I needed to wind the film etc etc and then we were off and on our way in under 5 minutes. Would highly highly recommend this place, I will be returning here for all my camera needs.
5

Review 129: Knowledgable staff. No pressure with sales.  Cory helped me with the best decision for upgrading my camera from d300 to D750.  Larry, the owner, helped research all Nikon rebates.  Paul recently helped me with sending a lens back to the manufacturer.  I am so grateful to have Nelson's staff as a professional resource for my photography needs.  More importantly... A place I can trust.  Thank you all.
5

Review 130: Congrats on the new location! Been a long time customer and love working with owners Nancy and Larry. Good selection of photo supplies and equipment and fair prices. Always willing to go the extra mile for their customers. 
Very friendly to both pros and ametures alike.
5

Review 131: Working with the team at Nelson Photo has been a great experience. Check out their new location in Point Loma, Awesome!
5

Review 132: A new location for a great store!  Congrats on the move.....
It's been a while since we've been in and we were so happy to be back and see so many familiar faces. As always we experienced great personal service and found what we needed.
 Westcott Umbrellas were in stock and at the best price!
See you again soon!
5

Review 133: Nelson is our go-to for everything we need as professional photographers! The NICEST, most approachable, and knowledgable staff in town, hands down. I'm so thankful we found them years ago and have committed to purchasing every item in our bags there. If they don't have it in stock, then they can order it! 

I always appreciate having a face behind my purchase, especially when you're spending thousands on gear. They've always taken amazing care of us and we wouldn't dream of going anywhere else! 

I was so excited when they opened up their rental department! A great addition to the line up of offerings. Fair and reasonable too. :)

Thanks, Nelson, for all your amazing support over the years!
5

Review 134: I've been buying camera gear at Nelson Photo for 21 years (since I arrived from Australia). Their customer service is impeccable, and you will always be greeted with a smile and a hello, when entering their store. I 'could' buy my gear online, but the rapport I've built with Larry, Nancy, and their staff is invaluable to me, I highly recommend them.
I, for one, am happy about their new location. It's closer to where I live, and pulling up to their store and seeing ample parking, is a breath of fresh air!

Review for A-1 Broadway Foto:
Review 1: Went in for a passport photo and had a very good experience. Mark is very friendly and has a lovely calm presence.  His work is very professional. Highly recommend A1 Broadway Foto !
5

Review 2: Professional, excellent quality product, and efficient. Very friendly and accommodating! Was able to get a New Zealand passport photo done in less than 15 minutes.
5

Review 3: Fast and friendly passport photographs! I was in and out in ten minutes. You get two photographs and he suggests mailing both photos with your application.
5

Review 4: We received a letter from the State Department  that the photos we got taken at Rite Aid were not compliant with government standards. We found A-1 on Yelp and went right away. Mark was so fast and got us new photos for the kids within minutes this morning. So grateful and hands down should have gone with the pro in the first place. Thank you Mark!
5

Review 5: Quick service. Great location. The person working at the front had a pleasant and welcoming demeanor. The quality of the photos was exceptional.
5

Review 6: A super aggressive, older white guy runs the place. He is unpleasant as can be but the price is right and the location is easy to find.
3

Review 7: Incredible service. Came in from LA, pulled up to this place, and wow, astonished with the owner Mark. Forget about how great and quick the service was, Mark is proof that there are still great people in this world. I needed my passport photo ASAP, and he also helped me with my passport packet. I wish we could get this type of service back in LA. Thank you Mark!
5

Review 8: I'm a Canadian expat living in San Diego and it's come time to renew my son's passports. The requirements for Canadian passport photos are a little different than US requirements so not every place it set up to do them. I called and got a very reasonable quote for the photos and then headed down the next day to get them. While it did take a little while to find street parking, the closest lot is quite expensive, we were in and out with photos in hand in around 30 minutes for both boys. The owner was very knowledgeable about the Canadian requirements and very professional. Highly recommend A-1 to anyone who needs Canadian passport photos or anyone looking for documentation photos in a hurry. Thank you!
5

Review 9: I needed my photos fast. I arrived before the store was supposed to open. They open the door and let me in and I was in and out in about 5min.  Awesome service.
5

Review 10: This little shop is a gem. Don't waste your time or money getting a photo taken at the passport office. It's so freaking terrible. This guy is fast and efficient and did a lovely job.
5

Review 11: Parking can be difficult, but worth the quality passport photo - only took five minutes, so only needed 15 minute parking. Located on Front and Broadway
5

Review 12: Awesome service - and very fast - five minutes to get professional photos.  He knows the various passport and visa requirements for photos and does his best to get portrait quality photos for your applications.  Prices are reasonable and centrally located on Front and Broadway in downtown.
5

Review 13: This place is by the Sofia hotel and by the coffee bean. I went in during my lunch break and was out in 5 minutes. The owner is very friendly. There's a mirror inside for last minute grooming. The owner takes about 3 poses and let's you choose your favorite. The picture quality is great and clear and this is why I chose this versus a drugstore. I am very happy with my passport photo and will definitely be back and recommend.
5

Review 14: Fantastic little passport photo place! The owner is such a cool character and he takes the photo with a proper Nikon digital SLR camera. Super clear photo and he even stapled it to my passport application for me. It's only $11 and some change for a proper passport photo.
5

Review 15: Made me look really cute on a rainy day when I should have looked like a drowned rat.   
Thank-you for your affordable pricing and great customer service.  
Hope you are there in 2029 for my next passport photo!
5

Review 16: Quick and efficient. I was in and out in a matter of minutes. Photo turned out great.  Very friendly staff.  I walked to the location from my home so I don't remember if parking nearby was available.  I suspect street parking which we all know can be a little tough in this part of town. Would definitely recommend and would use A-1 Broadway Foto again in the future!
5

Review 17: I walked in and in 5 minutes I had my photos ready. The man that works there is very sweet and professional. 
Good prices too!
5

Review 18: Fantastic experience. The entire visit took about 10 minutes and my photos turned out great! Thank you for making this so seamless (and being so friendly while doing it)!
5

Review 19: Great place to come if you need a passport/immigration photo. I received excellent customer service and was in and out of there in less than 10 minutes. He even gave me the renewal paperwork to mail out. The only bad thing is it's downtown so parking is....well you know.
5

Review 20: A-1 Broadway Foto is the place to go for visa and Green Card related things. I needed 6 printed fotos for a Green Card petition and a digital 2 inch x 2 inch foto for my H1B renewal, and the job was done in less than 20 minutes. The owner sends the digital foto to you by email (you can also bring a memory stick) and also makes sure that the foto taken meets the standard of the US consulate (he checked it by uploading the foto to the server). There is plenty of parking in the neighborhood, although expensive. Best to show up there early in the morning to avoid traffic. Pricing is very reasonable as well. Overall, I recommend this place and I am glad I found it here on yelp.
5

Review 21: Quick, easy and reasonable. Didn't think it could be so easy. Knowledgeable, pleasant and informative owner. Definitely recommend. You will be in and out in 5 minutes.
5

Review 22: Easy to find. Amazing quality pictures. Mark's an experienced photographer w/ old school vibe and decor. Spend the extra $2 here compared to big retail chains (awful lighting and quality). In and out in less than 5 minutes. Went in at 3:30pm on Friday. Only downside, I put in $1 in quarters for street parking. Ha. Not knowing it would be so fast! Thanks for the pictures.
5

Review 23: Guys get your passport pics taken here please if you don't want to lug around a mug shot of yourself when you travel. Mark is great and will let you choose from your photo shoot for something that's acceptable to your eye and the issuing passport authority who will be scrutinizing it. Thank you and see u in 10 years Mark. ‍
5

Review 24: Quick, easy and professional for passport photos. Not the easiest parking situation, since it's downtown, but I just happened to he in the area, so it worked out. Definitely recommend.
5

Review 25: Awesome service!! I was rushing to my appointment  and I found this place on yelp... THANK YOU fellow yelpers!! He took a few pics for me to choose from &amp; instructed me to get the perfect passport photo and also made copies for me and ran through a checklist of things I needed &amp; walked out and pointed me in the right direction to the passport agency (which is literally around the corner). The guy has 5 stars for a reason people!! This place is legit!!
5

Review 26: This store is really helpful for different size printing pictures, really tiny place next to valet of hotel, old guy knows what he is exactly doing. Pretty fast and great quality service little bit pricey but definitely recommended.
5

Review 27: Mark was incredible. Friendly, professional, and helpful. Told me it would take 15 minutes for my photos--had them to me in less than 5. Also gave me great advice on making sure I could get my passport as quickly as possible. I'll be back whenever I need a passport-style photo and will recommend this business to friends and coworkers. Made my day.
5

Review 28: Fast, easy and professional! Used it for a new passport photo renewal. Loved it, no wait and Mark was immensely professional and friendly. 

Happily recommend A-1 Broadway Foto to anyone!
5

Review 29: Picture quality is good and my photo came out within 10-20 minutes. But the owner seemed slightly racist to me. Well, I definitely don't look white and by default he thought I am an immigrant. He kept saying, for immigration photo you have to do this and that and I kept saying, no but it is for the US passport. He still kept repeating the same cr*p.

 How about a good customer service, Mark?

Review 30: If you were in downtown and ever in need of passport photos, go no further than A1 Broadway Foto. We were at the immigration office on front Street and needed to do a renewal. For the renewal process they require new photos and I left mine at home which I got from Costco for five dollars. I was contemplating driving home and grabbing the photos and coming back, however A-1 was able to do it in less than 10 minutes. The cost was only $12 and the owner was a nice guy too.
Make sure you keep an eye out for their front door, lots of people walk right past it. It's located next to a paid parking lot before you get to the corner of Broadway and Front.
5

Review 31: A-1 is definitely my go-to place whenever I need new pictures for passport or IDs. The photo will always be ready to pick up in 20 mins and the owner Mark will always make sure that it meets the requirement by uploading it to the DOE website to verify.

Highly recommended!
5

Review 32: Excellent service! I got me passport picture taken and had a chance to choose the best one out of five takes. Highly recommended!
5

Review 33: Owner is extremely friendly, knows the requirements on passport photos and will help you to ensure your photos are compliant. Reasonably priced and located close to the passport agency.

Highly recommended.
5

Review 34: This is the best place for passport photos!! My wife is from Canada and they know all the special requirements that are required. No matter where you are from this is the best place in San Diego for passport photos!!
5

Review 35: Great place to get your passport photos. The gentlemen was very nice and at tentative. Very informative about immigration and passport processes. Overall a world class business.
5

Review 36: Got my photos here a few years ago and had no problems with them.  Am sending my husband here to get his as I am confident they will be the quality the government expects.  Wanted to be sure and write my review so I can find it when it is time to renew again.  P.S.  Yes, the parking is terrible around that area.  Park a few blocks north and walk there...
5

Review 37: Love their foto quality n fast service. They also take passport foto for countries other than US. Highly recommend them.
5

Review 38: Great fast friendly service!  I came here around 1230pm during my lunch for a Chinese Visa photo. The gentlemen behind the counter knew exactly what I needed, a photo no smile but not mad.  The photo had really nice color and didn't excentuate all the bad stuff. I was in and out in less than 10 mins. Parking is kinda of a hassle. Went around the block a couple time before I found some free parking on 1st across from the jail. Good price too.
5

Review 39: Mark is a passport photo expert; been coming here for years before Yelp and getting my Canadian passport photos done.  Never had a problem!  He even retook the photos to meet specs.  Really hard to find an expert in international ID photos, quick, no appointment needed, and extended hours.  He opens for a few hours Saturday morning on 3 day weekends, check the website.
5

Review 40: Photos come out great! The quality of the picture is awesome. I also like that the he provides direction before he takes the photo. He'll take a few pictures and lets you choose the one you like best. 

The prices are great and his service is extremely quick. I was in and out in less than 10 minutes and there were a few people there. The clerk working there is super friendly and extremely knowledgeable regarding the passport procedures and even has good advice regarding the downtown office. 

Extremely satisfied with my products!
5

Review 41: Stopped here to take my passport photo! I don't think I was here for more than 10 minutes. The service was fast, cheap and the gentlemen working the shop was nice enough to offer tips and advice on what to do when applying for a passport for the first time! Highly recommend this place. Also, my pictures camera out INCREDIBLE on the second take!
5

Review 42: Mark was absolutely a pleasure to talk to, and very amicable. Not to mention that he's the only shop in town that can take an official UK passport photo (grey or cream background) correctly. 

Don't hesitate to go to A1 Broadway, I was in and out in about 5 minutes.
5

Review 43: I and my kids took some pictures for passport renew. We needed international one(Japan) and US. It was very quick and the owner was really kind. I'll definitery 
go back there again :) Thank you!!
5

Review 44: This is one of those places I would give 6 stars to if I could.

We have used A1 for four different family members so far- my husband, myself, our adult son and (at the time) our 1 1/2 year old grandson.

The owner is super knowledgeable about all things passport and makes sure your photos are taken correctly.

Does that make a difference? It does-  I know two people who had their passport applications denied because the agency rejected their drugstore photos (and when the photos are rejected they don't give you a reason)

If you have a little one you know how difficult it is to get them to sit still for a photo.  Mark is a magician- if you need a passport photo for a child you would be crazy to go anywhere else.

Another bonus- Mark knows how to take flattering shots.  I am not very photogenic and I hate having my picture taken. While every other government photo I've ever had looks like a mug shot, I actually get compliments on my passport photo.

And A1 is walking distance to the passport agency.

Highly recommend to anyone who needs a passport photo.
5

Review 45: I came here for a photo for a passport renewal.  After reading reviews, I wanted a passport photo that wouldn't get rejected and that would look decent, since I was going to have it for 10 years.  The guy was really nice.  They have a little mirror and allow you time to make sure you look nice before taking the photo.  I also appreciated that he took a couple photos and let me choose which one to use.  He also had plenty of info on the renewal process, and even gave me a (pretty accurate) estimate of how long it would take for me to get my passport.  I was in and out pretty quickly.  

I docked off a star for two reasons.  First, parking is IMPOSSIBLE.  I went on Presidents' Day, and still circled for about 20 minutes before I found a spot.  Second, something is off with my photo - I am blonde but the photo looks like I'm a redhead.  Also, I almost look like I was photoshopped onto a white background.  Not quite sure how or why.  It's not the best photo of me, and it's not the worst photo of me.  But, the photo was good enough - I got my passport with no problems, and how often do you look at your passport photo anyway?
4

Review 46: I needed set of passport photos, quick, because I had an appointment with the passport agency later that day.  I had gotten a set a few days earlier from another place, but they just were not very good.  Mark was fast and friendly.  He uses a professional quality DSLR Camera and the photo looks great.  Highly recommended.
5

Review 47: Had to get travel documents expedited for an upcoming trip and he had me ready to go with new photos within 10 minutes. Very knowledgeable - knew exactly what photos I needed for certain documents. No appointment necessary and accepts card or cash.
5

Review 48: I have been to A-1 Broadway photo probably a dozen times in the past 6 years to get visa, passport, and other government photos taken for myself and my family.  I really can't recommend this place enough.  The gentleman running the business is incredibly professional and knowledgable of the requirements of photos for all different kinds of visas, passports, immigration photos, etc, for many different countries.  He even seems to keep tabs on processing times for certain popular documents.

The prices are reasonable and most importantly, you can be confident that everything was done correctly.  Even the photos of my son first as a tiny infant and then squirmy toddler have all come out perfectly.

Whenever I leave I always think how nice it is to visit a business and a person who takes pride in being so competent and knowledgable in their specialty.  I wish there were more businesses around town like A-1!
5

Review 49: Probably the only place in SD that takes photos for non-US passports. I called ahead to ask, and Mark asked what passport it was for. By the time I got there later in the day he had looked up the specifications for my country so that the photos would adhere to the guidelines. In twenty minutes he took my picture, Photoshopped the sweat off my face (it was 100 degrees out that day), made sure the background photo color was identical to the old photo in my passport, and printed 'em out for me. Meticulous work, and Mark was very sweet. Exactly what a local business should be!

Anyone whose passport requires a BLUE background should come and give Mark their business.
5

Review 50: I needed a passport photo! And it took 5 minutes all in all..  for only 12$(2 pieces). I highly recommend this place!!
5

Review 51: Best place to get passport photos!  The owner is very friendly and tries to ensure you get the best looking..best quality photo that meets the requirements of the passport you are trying to obtain.  He takes a few shots and goes over them with you so you can decide which photo you like the most.  The only thing that sucks is the parking... trying to find parking down town can be rough...but it is well worth it...  I have been here multiple times and recommend it to everyone
5

Review 52: Went to this location based on all of the great reviews. I was not disappointed. The gentleman working was very nice. He allowed me to pick the best picture out of 2. I was having a bad hair day (curly hair problems) and had some flyaways in my photo. He removed them without me even having to ask.  He even went out of his way to print me out the passport forms that I needed.  I highly recommend going to A-1 Broadway Foto!
5

Review 53: If you have a newborn baby, come here without hesitation! Just had passport photo taken of my 3 week old here (and three years ago my 5 week old at the time)! I was worried about how I was going to make my baby hold her head, but the gentleman here has a soft pillow to put your baby on so the little one doesn't have to hold her/his head . I've been here many times and always satisfied with the service! Always great quality pictures here!

Review 54: AVOID, Especially UCSD Students
My experience was terrible here. I saw a great review of A-1 Broadway on yelp, so I drove a half hour there to take the photo for my opt application, which needs a passport standard of photo. It was great at first, and I really appreciate the owner's service and his photo. However, the photo was rejected by the officers in the international center, because of the shadows on my neck on the photo. The international center asks me to retake the photo, or I may risk my opt application by sending such a photo. Then I went back to A-1 broadway and asked the owner to retake the photo and I was willing to pay for the new photos. But the owner became very angry, and said that his photos were never rejected and he refused to take photos for me. He also mentioned he had students from UCSD getting rejected by the school officers before, but he insisted that his photos are perfect for the applications. He repeated his perfect record and did not consider for my situation at all.
I cannot risk my application because of the unqualified photo, because I may lose the application fee of $380 and get my visa status jeopardized. So I still need to take my photos again somewhere else after my TWO visits in this store.  BE AWARE!
//update
You did talk about the refund, but you said in this way, "send your application with the photo, if you get rejected then I will give you refund." The point is that I do not care about the $12, but I am worried about my application. If it gets rejected, I will loose my right to work in the U.S, which means I have to give up the job offer I already got. So I just wanted another photo, but you refused. You cannot do it, maybe because you do not have the light stand. Anyway, it wasted lots of my time. I just want other people to be aware of this.

Review 55: Had a great, no-hassle experience here getting my passport photo taken at A-1 Broadway Foto.
Great location, right by my work.
It is located right by the Downtown Courthouse on the corner of Broadway and Front Street.
Run by a kind, courteous older gentlemen and you can tell he's had a lot of experience.

I was in and out in under 5 minutes. 
He took two photos, let me choose which photo I liked better, and in no time I was out of there.
The two photo printouts came out to $12.95 and yes he accepts card.
5

Review 56: Perfect Canadian passport photos here.  Well worth the price.  Friendly service from Mark and he put a transparent gloss over the company stamp so that the ink doesn't get smeared.
5

Review 57: Best passport photo experience I have ever had.  In and out in less than ten minutes.  Very friendly and personable dude.  Great quality photos.  Cheap.  Convenient.  If you are worried about parking, park in the Horton Plaza Mall Garage, validate your parking at one of the many outdoor kiosks in the mall for free (3 hours), then walk 2 blocks to A-1 Foto.  This entire process took me less than 25 minutes.

Highly Recommended!!
5

Review 58: I've had at least five passport-style photos taken over the last few years (new citizen!!) and I have to say this is the best I've had so far.  It's definitely worth the drive downtown and hunt for parking, if you want a nice photo for your passport.  The service was quick and friendly and the owner was very knowledgeable about passport services.  

**For those of you that might be going to the swearing-in ceremony, it's only a short walk away from Golden Hall (save yourself looking for parking again).
5

Review 59: Rushed in 15-20 minutes before closing for passport pictures. We were still greeted friendly and easy going. The picture is the best passport picture I have ever seen and with $12.99 for two pictures it's a good deal. I would recommend this little photo studio to anyone.
5

Review 60: The worst costume service ever 
The guy charge 26 dlls for 4 photos 
When he has a sign with low prices, and I asked why he charger that and he was very rude .... Don't go there!!!
1

Review 61: Fast, affordable, nice owner, easy to deal with.  Would recommend. Great with kids too, my 5 month old needed a passport photo, very easy.
5

Review 62: I seriously cannot recommend A-1 more... I was basically panicking after having my photo taken at a competitor a few blocks away, and now I'm actually convinced that airlines will let me board flights and other countries will LET ME IN for the next ten years!

Mark is kind, prompt, and knowledgeable. Overheard him telling the customer ahead of me that if they photo is rejected, it is on him -- and he has never had a rejection.

Head's up: America is basically the last country that allows smiling photos; I wouldn't recommend grinning because other countries do have issues with it... the most important thing to note? Our own post offices don't usually know that photos with smiles are allowed, and unless you want a bad experience, just don't smile broadly in your photos. Smile with your eyes, and if you have a built in smirk like mine, that's OK.
5

Review 63: I stopped by this shop around 11am on a Monday to have new passport photos taken. The gentleman that helped me was great.  He quickly took my photo and made sure I approved, then printed 6 copies ($22) in less than 10 minutes. While I was waiting, he told me that there was a "hidden" passport office right by the Civic Theatre down the block. I walked over afterwards and a nice woman helped me without an appointment. She double checked my documents and gave me a priority mail envelop which I dropped off at the post office in  Horton Plaza. This was such a pleasant experience and I would recommend this business for passport pictures!
4

Review 64: You're stuck with the same passport photo for 10 years so I wanted to get a decent photo at least. Instead, I got the best passport photo I've had in my life here. The photographer was knowledgeable with passport photo rules and requirements. The lighting and quality was great and the photographer took a few shots and allowed me to choose which one I liked the most. All turned out great and I'm sure I wouldn't have had a better turnout at a drugstore photo place. It was about $11.95 for 2 photos, but with the quality of it, it's super worth it. I wish the DMV had the same photo company so I have better license photos!
5

Review 65: Was in and out in about five minutes, the longest part was looking for parking. Convenient, friendly service, and the picture came out great on top of it! The place is right around the corner from the Sofia Hotel near the courthouse and all the bail bonds places, so it might be hard to find parking. I was there in the middle of the day and was in and out in no time. Honestly, even if you had a friend drop you off and circle the block a couple times, you'd be done!
5

Review 66: Excellent place for immigration photos or passport photos. 
A real photographer A+++
Don't use Walgreens employees to take your picture for your passport photos.
5

Review 67: Excellent service! My boyfriend and I stopped by today at noon for passport photos. We were in and out in less than thirty minutes. The gentleman who took our photos was very nice, and he even gave us specific directions to the passport agency's office, which is three blocks away. If you're in need of passport photos, I would highly recommend A-1 Broadway Foto.

Warning: Do NOT park in the paid lot next door. It's $20 for 0-1 hour. You're better off driving around to find street parking. Just some friendly advice. :)
5

Review 68: Great service! I went there to have picture taken to apply for certificate of Canadian Citizenship. The owner is very friendly and knowledgable!  Highly recommended!

Review 69: Came here to get some last-minute passport photos and it was definitely an outstanding service. They open one hour prior to the passport agency, so it's super convenient. The photographer had a really warm personality and was friendly from the second I stepped in til I left. He took a couple of pictures and let me choose which the one for my passport, and I liked that he encourages smiles.
5

Review 70: The owner is very rude. Long wait. Hard to find parking. Pricy as well. He did a lot of photoshop to make the photos looks prettier but fake.

Review 71: This place is everything!!!!  The owner was super friendly and efficient. He had a clipboard,black pen and the application to get my passport. I recommend this place to anyone!!!!

Review 72: I went there to get my photos taken for a Schengen visa. The man that worked there was very nice and helpful. He seemed to know all the required sizes for each country. The entire process was very fast; within minutes I had my photos already printed. The pricing is very reasonable. I would definitely recommend going to this place!
5

Review 73: FAST! I only got passport photos done, but I was in and out and the photos looked stellar! I had a friend drive me so that I didn't have to find parking, and he didn't make it around the block before I was done. 

The photo looked EXCELLENT! I mean it wasn't a glamor shot, but he instructed me to raise my chin and make minor adjustments. It only took two shots and the print outs had good exposure and contrast. Save yourselves the trips around town (and some cash) and just come here first.
5

Review 74: I have been rushing around to get this last minute passport and searched Yelp to find a store near me to take the photos. Thank goodness this place popped up! Like all of the other reviews, my experience was amazing! First, they open early which for me was a relief since I had to run off and go straight to the passport agency located a few blocks away. The owner was pleasant from the get go, took my picture within moments and chatted with me while it developed. I did not even feel like I was there for 5 minutes before he gave me my envelope and even pointed out exactly where I was going and how to get there. If every experience was like this I must say this world would be a much better place.Thanks again and keep it up!

Review 75: The best place in town if you need differently sized photographs for visa applications or foreign passport renewals. The price is right too. I called around multiple places to get a 45mm x 35mm foreign passport renewal photo taken and printed with the right parameters without any luck or a price tag of $60 for 2 photos. This place had no problem looking up different country's photo requirements to confirm that's what I needed and it was only $25 for 6 photos.

I won't go any where else for passport photos. Thank you A-1 Broadway!
5

Review 76: The gentleman there was ever so helpful. The Sevice was personal and quick. I can't think of a better experience.
Many thanks.

Review 77: What a great little hole in the wall!  We came here extremely last minute (the day before my husband flew to an appointment at the Russian consulate in SF) to get photos for a Russian passport renewal.  This place is right by the Sofia Hotel- you have to look twice to see it, but is otherwise in a great location downtown.  Plus, they were open until 6pm- which allowed us to come after work on a Thursday.  The place was manned by just one guy, and the space was pretty sparse, but the owner was quick to direct and take the photos we needed.  We waited only 5min for them to be printed and cropped, and enjoyed looking at the old cameras and the old cash register in the place.  The owner really lit up when we started asking him about them.  Cool place- very small but extremely professional and well priced.  I would highly recommend A-1 for photography needs!
5

Review 78: Not only did he take great photos, he asked me if I was happy with them before printing, and then made sure I knew how to get to the passport office giving me directions around road construction.
5

Review 79: Super convenient location and really easy to get a passport photo taken. You walk in to this really small place, say "I need a photo taken" take a glance in the mirror, sit on a chair and about 5 minutes later, boom passport photo in hand and $12 out of your pocket. Overall, great price, great experience and perfect location (walking distance to downtown passport agency).
5

Review 80: Used them for a 4week old needing a passport photo. He was great, the photos turned out much better than I expected. I gave this guy a pretty hard time when I walked in because he was so busy and was told could be a long wait.....his customer service was actually really good, he got us in and out really quick in the end.....he even gave us the passport forms we would need. Very pleasant...I really recommend.
5

Review 81: Well, I read wanted to write a review for the first time, just to help saving someone's else time and money,

Before I came to A1 passport photo I had already spent $24 for two sets of passport photos (private shop called BANKS PHOTO INTERNATIONAL and CVS) they were horrible colors, quality and stressful process in total (I'll try to post the photos and difference)
5

Review 82: This guy is awesome. The entire process took about 10 minutes. He even touched up the shaving cut I have on my face! Every review is true. Friendly and very knowledgeable. If he tells you something about photos, take it as gospel. Thank you again!
5

Review 83: Mark is great!
Made pictures for me and my baby for Russian Passport, and even was nice to save one of the smiley baby pictures that he liked and wanted me to keep it for myself.
He was prompt and professional.
Definitely recommend this place!
5

Review 84: Best service ever! Not even 5 min to get passport photos. $12 for 2 photos. Parking is terrible, but that's downtown San Diego for you. Great "photographer humor" and a gorgeous antique cash register on display. Most highly recommended!
5

Review 85: Awesome place the guy that works  there is really amazing really nice and knows a lot!!! Less then 5 mins im happy
5

Review 86: Had to get photos done before 8 and they are the only ones crazy enough to be open this early! Took multiple photos to make sure the customer is satisfied!  Great job Mark!
5

Review 87: Headline: THE ONLY PLACE SO FAR HAVING DIGITAL COPIES

I am a foreign citizen and need to apply for US visa, unfortunately starting from somewhere, a digital copy is required. Sad new is, CVS/FedEx don't have such service (or people don't know how to operate) and thus I have been frustrated for a while.

By asking almost everywhere I got this place and I tried it out a few days ago.  Very quickly I have the photos done and verified by USCIS website and emailed to me.  The owner for sure knows what he's doing very well and was very professional.

In short, nvm about the price and parking. They get stuff done. That's worth everything.
5

Review 88: I definitely recommend this place to anyone who fusses over having a nice passport photo! Easy in and out service. Very affordable. Very knowledgeable and helpful.
5

Review 89: Just wanted to update my review and say that I recently got my passport in the mail.  The photo was accepted no problem! In ten years when I need to repeat the painful process of passport renewal I will come here to make it a little less painful.  Come here for your passport needs! You won't regret it!
5

Review 90: Went here for a Canadian passport photo and it was very quick and perfectly done. 

I've had my passport photo rejected before when I had gone to a different place to get them done, but they were accepted the first time from here.

The owner even knows rules that aren't officially printed because he's been to the Canadian consulate and asked.

Definitely will return for any passport photo needs.
5

Review 91: When I think of my passport process, I don't think I'd anything pleasurable, unless I'm getting another stamp inside, but this place just changed my perception. I walked in, had my picture taken and was out of there in less than five minutes. I even got done friendly conversation while I was there. Great experience in every aspect. Anytime I need a passport picture, I know where to go and so do you!
5

Review 92: Quick and easy! The gentlemen that works there knows all about international requirements for picture sizes (passports/visas). He let me review the pictures and made sure that i was satisfied with the quality before printing.  
Very reasonably priced service.
5

Review 93: After having an ugly, depressing photo taken at Postal Annex in Hillcrest, I checked Yelp for a better photographer.  A-1 Broadway Foto (located next door to the Sofia Hotel) is the place.  

The guy is super nice and takes his time to give you a decent photo.  There's a large mirror on the wall which I used to brush my hair.  After discussing with me how to pose, the photographer took 3 pix and displayed them on his monitor for me to select the best one.  My photo was pretty good - not ugly, at least - so I'm happy!  The entire experience took maybe 10 minutes and cost $11.

I hate searching for parking downtown, so I took the city bus.  I definitely recommend this place for people who freak out at bad passport photos which you must show for the next 10 years!
5

Review 94: I would like to mirror all of the positive feedback that has been expressed about Mark and this place of business. Speedy is an understatement. There was a gentleman waiting for his photos to finish printing as I walked in, and before I could grab a seat Mark asked what I needed help with, then immediately had me check myself in the mirror and then have a seat in the chair to take my photo. I sat down, and Mark had me make one adjustment and then adjusted the camera from there to be sure the photo was taken properly. He took one shot and it was perfect! Not sure if that was me or him that made it look so good ;-)! He showed me the shot to be sure that I approved and in the 3 minutes it took to print the photo, Mark was giving me helpful information to continue with the passport application process. After my short wait and the kindness in his heart to let me charge my dead phone, I paid $11 and was on my way. I could not have been in the shop for longer than 10 minutes no exaggeration. I love this place and will suggest EVERYONE see Mark to get the job done right and in a time efficient manner.
5

Review 95: I agree with another reviewer that said "this was the best photo taking experience I have had in a while!"

Canadians take note! It was really difficult to find a place that took Canadian passport photos. After 4 failed attempts, I was referred to A-1 Broadway Foto.

It was hard to find at first because it is a tiny shop just north of the Sofia Hotel downtown so you don't see it on the street right away. It is between Broadway and C Street and parking is hard to find. I found parking around B street at a meter and walked to the shop.

It was a truly a seamless experience, the owner was kind and very professional. He made sure my expression and positioning were perfect and ensured that my photos were exactly up to Canadian passport standards.

It took 10-15 minutes at most, and in no time I had my photos ready. If you need Canadian passport photos taken this is the best place to get them done!
5

Review 96: I needed passport photos; this experience was quick and efficient. It's a small room shop with great antique cameras to admire, a mirror and a chair. He takes 3 photos and let's you pick your favorite.. bada bing bada boom. He's very helpful, even provided me with the renewal form and instructions on what to do next. Thank you for making it so simple!
5

Review 97: Amazing. I've been putting off my passport picture for ages because I thought it would be such a hassle. I was in and out of this place in less than 5 minutes...it's taking me longer to walk to my car than the whole picture process. And $11 isn't bad.
5

Review 98: Just visited them to grab a last minute passport photo and the man working was so pleasant and helpful! It's always nice to encounter someone who enjoys their job! He took a great photo!
5

Review 99: Normally wouldn't bother reviewing for something as profoundly boring as passport photos. BUUUUT this place is a minor miracle.

I had my photos within minutes of walking in the door.
Owner knows his shit.
Kinda bossy, but hey, he managed to get rid of my bitchy resting face for one of the shots, so I can't complain.

A+
5

Review 100: Another 5 stars for this place &amp; I know why! I had to get a pic for my Australian passport and the photography was perfect! Even the Australian Consulate in LA recommend this place as believe this or not, you can't smile for an Aussie passport, and have very particular measurement requirements, as too lightning, distance, etc etc etc. Please note, I had some done the night prior at a FedEx store, it was way more expensive and they were NOT done to the required specifications (even though I took in the spec sheet), passable for an American Passport perhaps, but I knew immediately they couldn't be used &amp; would had to led to an automatic passport renewal rejection.
5

Review 101: I needed Canadian passport pics and did the google thing and came up with this place.  The reviews are great and deserved.  Nice guy at the desk.  In and out in 15 min.  Charged me $18 for 2 pics.  A guy in North Park wanted $35 for 2 plus $1 for using a credit card.
5

Review 102: This was the best photo taking experience I have had in a while!

Just needed regular passport photos. The owner made sure I went to the mirror to touch myself up and get the shine off my forehead.

I said "I really don't care how my photos looks as long as I am recognized and let back into the States" he said, "Well I do". *Boom*

He took 4 pix making sure angling and smile was right. Then he let me view them all. "We" decided on the best pix.

This passport is gonna be Top Model fierce! 

Cost $11.50 for 2 regular photos, Photo experience "priceless"
5

Review 103: It is sooooooo worth it going to a place that specializes in passport photos like this, instead of settling for the post office or something. My last passport pic was taken at the post office and it was very muddy and grainy looking. 

This had to be the most painless process I ever had to go through.

I was in and out of the door in less than 5 minutes.
The owner is super friendly. He made sure I was 100% taken care of and then even showed me the passport agency afterwards (literally across the street from his business!)

I was so pleased with the quality and efficiency of the service. There is a mirror so you can fix yourself up before the picture. The qualities of the photos are AMAZING! I looked great in mine and couldn't be happier. 

I highly recommend. :)
5

Review 104: Perfect.  The gentleman there knows his stuff.  Need passport photos for a Canadian passport.  In and out in 15 minutes.  Couldn't be better.
5

Review 105: The Greatest Photo House. If you need any camera pictured photos, this place should be your only choice. For all my russian friends and abroad travellers, if you need an international self-shots for various passes/visas/passports, stop by Broadway Foto Shop.
5

Review 106: Super fast in and out in like 5 mins.

Very professional, family owned business for many years he knows what he's doing.

Extremely friendly and helpful!!
5

Review 107: I always feel awkward being photographed but this guy was really cool. He let me re-take my photo a couple of times and he even made me smile which totally never happens when I pose for anything. I paid about $11 and was out of there quickly. I even let him pick the final photo!
5

Review 108: Woohoo! As good as it gets!

I am [was] a passport photo newbie and don't have any past passport photo taking experiences to compare my experience at A-1 Broadway Foto with so I can only confirm what others have already posted. I was mainly impressed with the service, quality, and humor (I think that covers everything). I felt at ease as soon as I walked in the door. Ten minutes later I was walking out the door with a photo that I was surprised I took (is that really me?). I'm wondering if they do wedding photos too...?

He even referred me to a new passport office that recently opened for expedited service that does not require travel plans.

Seriously though...I would be very surprised if anyone could not give this business 5 stars.
5

Review 109: Great service. If you are looking to have a passport photo taken, look no further. 

No appointment needed, photos ready in less than 10 minutes, and he is very knowledgeable about the requirements for the photos. As a Brit renewing my passport overseas, the attention to detail was especially important so as not to delay the application process. Five stars. 

Note: Parking is tough downtown, but there is a public lot on Front St. just past Broadway, which charges $2 per 15 min. Because the photo turnaround time was so quick, it cost me $4 with time to get a coffee. Better than the hassle of driving around trying to find a meter.
5

Review 110: This guy is a great photographer. I didn't realize that I was looking swaggerlisious until I got the photos. ...LOL J/K!

From the lighting to the comfort and privacy A-1 Fotos is awesome.
5

Review 111: Wow, no wonder this place has perfect 5-star reviews! I'm so much happier with these photos than I thought was even possible...
Needing a passport photo was not something I looked forward to, with my almost complete inability to take a decent photo, ever. I was very pleasantly surprised!
Parking was the most difficult part (&amp; really not that bad considering), so try to go at off times &amp; not lunchtime like I did. Super nice &amp; pleasant guy, very quick even though he took his time with the photo &amp; took a couple of shots, &amp; pics printed in 5 minutes. They came out SHOCKINGLY good- these rank pretty high among the few decent-looking pics I've taken in my lifetime, better even than some of the results I've had from extended pro photographer sessions. Definitely unexpected for passport photos.A surprisingly pleasant experience!
5

Review 112: It is true. Walk in and walk out 8 minutes later with passport photos. 
Parking in downtown still tough but I got lucky with a spot.
5

Review 113: I was in and out in 5 minutes. Great picture on the first try. I was the only customer on a Monday early afternoon. Parking is a hassle but the great and friendly service made up for that. This place is a must for passport photos. They even have a mirror for you to use to make sure you are looking your best!
5

Review 114: Absolutely the best place to go for passport photos.  I walked in the door to hear someone exclaim in surprise "Wow; these turned out great!" and I had a feeling that I'd come to the right place. Mark was super-friendly and helpful.  He took the photos as an actual photographer trying to get the best results (reminding me not to squint and to look up), rather than just having you stand on the X and click.  He took 4 shots, and let me pick my favorite, and while I didn't look like a supermodel, it was SUCH an improvement over the horrible washed-out photos from the prior 2 places I'd gone to.

As a bit of trivia, Mark told me his parents owned the business in 1947, and he and his brother started working there 50 yrs ago in 1962. The original cash register and his original camera are there in the shop if you want to check them out. I would absolutely recommend A-1 to everyone!
5

Review 115: Arrived here following Yelp reviews.

The owner was incredibly helpful, patient and friendly. He'll work with you to ensure you like your pic and he is very knowledgeable about all things related to gov't issued photo ID (photos for US visas, US immigration docs, passport from other countries, visas for other countries, etc etc). Anywho, the whole deal took about 10 mins. Best passport photo I've EVER had! :-)  

I live within walking distance, so parking wasn't an issue for me, but do keep in mind that finding a spot might be a challenge depending on the day/time you stop by. Still, if you're like me in that you're just not naturally photogenic, and need an understanding soul who strives to make you look your best, A-1 Broadway is where you need to go!!!
5

Review 116: I'm a Canadian renewing my Canadian passport and came here to have my photos taken. Passport Canada is super picky about photos and sizing and I wanted to make sure they were done right so that my passport application wouldn't be sent back to me,  (I've heard it's happened to other Canadian ex-pats!) A1 Foto had them done quickly (15 mins!) with all the correct dimensions (I measured when I got home to be sure!) all for the low low price of $17. Bonus, my photos were nicer than the ones on my last passport!

I'm taking one star off because although the man working there was knowledgeable and quick, I found him to be a bit brusque and seemed rather impatient - though in fairness he had 5 customers in his teeny tiny store at one time and seemed a bit busy.
4

Review 117: The owner was very polite, and knew what he was doing. He definitely lives up to the high reviews on yelp. He is located right next yo the Sophia Hotel, if you go past broadway, you have gone too far.
5

Review 118: Quick and easy ( I was in and out in less than 5 minutes) and the man who helped me was extremely kind. Would recommend this place to anyone. I found street parking with a meter but apparently you can park at the Sofia Hotel valet for a bit. Thanks so much for your help!
5

Review 119: I have to do a quick review for A-1 Broadway Foto because my experience there was so great.

They open early - in fact, they conveniently open an hour earlier than the County Administration Center in case you're trying to beat the passport crowds.

Parking sucks in this part of town, but luckily, the valet guys at The Sofia Hotel next door will let you park in their loading zone since you'll only be at A-1 for 10 minutes max. So nice. 

The owner - I didn't catch his name - is sweet. I was a little annoyed at first that he wanted my bangs off my face (um, that's just how they come?) but then I realized he genuinely wants to make your passport experience as easy as possible. Mine was a breeze, so I ended up appreciating his attention to detail.

Two passport photos are $11, cards are accepted, and you're in and out the door with what you need in under 10 minutes. I'm so glad I found this place!
5

Review 120: Excellent and fast service. Went in to get fingerprints and the owner/manager was very fast &amp; thorough.  Prices are also very reasonable compared to other places. I won't be going anywhere else for passport photos/ fingerprinting (which will hopefully be the last time). Parking can be difficult - the only downside, but everything else makes it worth coming here.
5

Review 121: Very friendly, fast and most importantly PROFESSIONAL!  
All 4 of our family members' passport photos were done to exact specs and even touched up to look perfect.  Highly recommended.
5

Review 122: Yay! Canadian passport photos (notorious for strict requirements)...done and done right for $17 in about 10 minutes. 

It's a tiny space, but you don't really need much room for this place.  You could pretty much do this in a closet, and that's about how big this place is.  

Another plus...it's right next door to a Coffee Bean.
5

Review 123: just got my photos here for my citizenship - Professional - fast - friendly - knowledgeable - and affordable. After a terrible experience at another location, I was really happy here. Thanks!
5

Review 124: I have been to this place twice, and both times I was extremely satisfied with the service and the quality of the photos.  The guy is very professional and told me that he does his work as if he was doing it for his wife :) so you know he does an awesome job! 
I highly recommend this place!
5

Review 125: I was very happy with the passport photos I got here. This place is very professional, speedy and the person who took the photo was great! I highly recommend this place.

Review for George’s Camera:
Review 1: Disappointed. I used to rent lens when I lived in Hawai'i from our local shop all the time, but this experience fell short. My husband came in to pick up a lens, and the associate kept trying to push another lens brand that we didn't want. I wanted a specific lens to shoot astrophotography, and am welcome to suggestions, but I knew what I wanted. My husband came home with a different lens... the associate rented him the wrong one (same brand, totally different lens) even after all that back and forth. My husband felt bad that he didn't double check, but also he had this long back and forth with the associate about which lens, everybody just probably got confused . We didn't figure it out until after the shop was closed and it was the weekend. We were also drove far away to shoot the skies. Came to return today and explained the situation, but it was basically "too bad". Also - the prices here are pretty high compared to other shops. I didn't get to shoot like I had intended because I had the wrong lens. Ugh. Going to try other shops after this. This was a total bust.

Yelp 2021 Challenge: 04/40

Review 2: very rude customer service. it was a very uncomfortable experience. i do not recommend coming here. places like this are why people buy everything off amazon
1

Review 3: I've never been in a camera store but George's seems like THE spot. I came in with my gf to develop film on some disposable cameras from last year and I was pretty amazed by how big this place is for a camera store. 

Looks like they'd have anything you're looking for from specific film types, cameras old and new, lighting equipment, and tripods of many different sizes and purposes. Super cool place to browse. They even have their own George's camera shirts and some dope enamel pins that caught my attention. 

The lot is small in the front but they advise to park in the back for the time being. The lot is bigger. Check this place out if you're a photographer!!
5

Review 4: They didn't tell me how long it would take for my film roll to develop. I called and was transferred to 3  different staff before I could get an answer. They told me it would be 2-3weeks. That's pretty long, but I ended up getting it back in about 10 days.

Review 5: I went in for a camera repair back in August because of the great reviews I saw on google for a camera repair. I paid the $10.00 service fee so the camera can be looked at then I was quoted $272.00 for the camera to be returned in full working order according to Thomas. I made numerous attempts to contact about an update on my camera and the status of the repair and was not met with any update. Now at the end of October, two Months later after calling again I was informed they were unable to repair it after I already payed the $272 in order to be returned in working conditions  only to be informed that during the repair another complication had occurred and I would need to pay for additional services. Thomas did admit to me that he and George's Camera should have done a better job communicating what was going on with my camera with me which I agree with as well. So essentially my experience with Georges camera repair service resulted in me paying 272.00 for them to look at it and cause a new problem with my camera. I then spoke with the manager Jim who admitted he was unsure if the camera was now repairable and that they should have never attempted to fix this camera from the beginning yet prior to saying this Thomas was still willing to charge me for additional service. The manager did not realize what was wrong with the camera even though my invoice that they wrote clearly stated what was wrong with it. My advice for anyone looking to do business here is to understand you will be paying a lot for them to attempt to fix it so try looking somewhere that will charge you after work is complete.

Review 6: I went in today to buy a tripod and a wider angle lens than my current 50mm. I'm still new to the world of photography so I leaned on Billy to guide me through the product selection. In 20 minutes I had EXACTLY the tripod and lens I needed for a shoot I had the next day (XC-M525K tripod and Tamaron 24mm F2.8) at an AMAZING price. 

The best past about the customer service at this location is that I can describe what I need and a price and I can 100% trust the recommendations of the experts like Billy.
5

Review 7: I come here all the time to get my film developed and I am never disappointed. When I first came in I didn't know anything about my camera and I was able to ask them every question under the sun and they never made me feel judged or stupid for not knowing more about cameras. 

They even showed me how to tell if my lens was dirty (mine had mold in it) and taught me all about the nitty gritty of my camera. When I was first starting they would even unload and load the film in my camera for me. I've come into this store just to drop off film and end up staying for an hour just talking and learning all I can from their staff, definitely my favorite camera store in San Diego.
5

Review 8: The customer service at George's is excellent (even in this crazy COVID time)! I had a badly stuck UV filter that needed to be taken off. The guy took his time to help and didn't charge me for this work. Ended up buying a bunch of things at the store in return. You guys rock and I 100% recommend it!
5

Review 9: Awesome camera shop with extremely knowledgeable and helpful staff. They've got everything you need for photography and videography. I'm very happy with my camera purchase and the advice I was given. I will definitely be back!
5

Review 10: If you are in the market for a new camera, microphone, light, filter, or anything else related to photography, George's is for you. They have one of the best selections of high quality photo gear in San Diego, which is in addition to rentals and photography classes. I just have to ding them a star because they lack in the video department. Not a consumer or prosumer video camera in sight. Other than that, they are definitely worth checking out.
4

Review 11: I appreciate everyone at the store. Always helpful in person and over the phone! Thank you for your service during the COVID restrictions as well!
5

Review 12: I began a digital photography class this semester and came to George's to get a camera where I could adjust the settings. I didn't realize the amount of knowledge and experience I would run into here. They won't steer you wrong and the shop has pretty much anything you would want. If you don't see it in the floor, ask. They also have a rental shop where you can try new lenses and such before you buy. Pretty cool.
5

Review 13: I came in to get repair and the man directed me to go to Kurts because I can get an estimate on spot whereas he knew how badly I needed my camera for work and was helping me possibly have a faster turn around time. Appreciated his knowledge and help !
5

Review 14: This place has great customer service and the employees all know so much about the craft. All the questions I had where answered and I got myself an amazing new camera! Go check this place out!
5

Review 15: Best camera store I've been to. The people that work there are so helpful! They all know their stuff! Quality!
5

Review 16: Patrick at George's Camera in Clairemont Mesa was very patient with me today.  He probably spent an hour and a half showing me different lens options to replace my fifteen year old Nikon 70-200mm 2.8 lens that broke.  I was nervous about spending a lot of money on a new lens, and I appreciate that he didn't try to up-sell me, or pressure me into buying a lens I couldn't afford.  The store was pretty busy, and I have to say that someone was always checking in on me to see if I needed any help while Patrick helped other customers when I was trying to decide which lens to purchase.  You can't get that customer service on-line!  I highly recommend George's Camera in Clairemont Mesa, and I will continue to do business there when I move on from my SLR to a mirrorless camera some day!

Review 17: Friendly, knowledgeable and helpful place. Patrick took the time to give my wife and I advice on some old camera equipment we had. He went above and beyond and the rest of the staff was very accommodating also. We will definitely be using them for future purchases.

Review 18: Have been back several times and my experiences were better. While I would love to buy from stores like this rather than Amazon, there is a 15% restocking fee for any purchase. It does make one pause if you think the item could be returned.

Review 19: Amazing place and great customer service! Staff is extremely knowledgeable! Go see the team!

Review 20: Stocked with latest as well as some older cameras you cant find elsewhere. Really liked this store and might come back for an old Canon ! Some of the cameras he has here are incredible when it comes to natural light photography.

Review 21: Had a seamless rental of a lens I really wanted to use for a graduation event at a local restaurant.
Prices are fair, but you do have to pay a deposit, either cash or credit card which is an active hold on your credit card so that you return equipment, and as a guarantee for no damages.
The nice thing is after five rentals with them, you no longer have to place a deposit! I rented a very fancy Canon lens, one of which is quite hard to afford. It was a great lens, in perfect mint condition, and I look forward to renting from the company again. The service was great, it was not busy at all, and there is quite a large selection for camera equipment for many brands of cameras. If you come here, you will certainly be met with people who are friendly, willing to help, to look for everyone of your camera/filming needs!

Review 22: David and Patrick were amazing to help set up my brand new auto, the team here is the reason I come back..total professionals and always go the extra mile. Love this store
5

Review 23: This place is great! The people there are so upbeat and helpful. They helped me complete several different transactions and were pleasant throughout the whole thing and were very knowledgeable, not only with the equipment but it's usage as well so they get 5 stars.

Review 24: Came here to get my camera fixed. The guy who helped me was really helpful and told me it would take a few weeks for me to get my camera back. To my surprised, it only took a week and a half. Prices were affordable. It was less cheaper for me to get my camera fixed vs. buying a new one. They told me the issue with it, now I know not to take my camera to the beach, or at least be careful that sand does not get stuck in the camera. I will definitely be back here if I have any camera issues.

Review 25: I had the pleasure of taking a night sky astrophotography class in May at George's camera, it was hosted by Larry from George's Camera and Paul Van Allen from Nikon. 

The cost was $35 for just the class at George's, but if you signed up for the workshop out at Joshua tree in June, you could get the workshop and the class for $199 total, and save the $35.

The class was very good with plenty of information about night sky photography, including long exposure, light painting, time lapse, and star trails. Paul also covered what apps to use to find the stars, what website to check for dark sky locations, stacking software, what gear to bring, changing your picture control settings, High ISO NR, white balance, and all the other settings for all the topics.

There were hundreds of slides and hints which we were allowed to take pics of instead of trying to write it all down. Paul really knows his stuff and tried to be sensitive to the non Nikon owners. He gave us his social media information and a way to check the settings on all of his pictures.
After the class, the 14 of us that signed up for the $199 workshop and class, got a special treat from Paul for Nikon gear to use at George's, this alone was worth the price of the class and workshop.

The workshop meeting time was 5 pm and we got to our spot at Joshua tree a little after 6. We were treated to have not only Paul from Nikon there but 2 other Nikon reps and a Nikon ambassador, and 2 or 3 people from George's camera. I think there were 7 experts and 15 or 16 students, so it was almost like having your own private instructor all night.

Larry from George's is extremely friendly, listens well, loves to answer questions and is very helpful. He helped out as much as he could in class but he was very helpful with all of the students out at the workshop at Joshua tree, answering questions about settings, not only for Nikon, but Sony, Canon, etc. 

If you have always wanted to film the milky way and were not sure how, do yourself a favor and take the class at least but if you want to go try it out, then sign up for the workshop. What a wonderful experience.

Review 26: I took my DSLR in to have the lens cleaned. They did a great job but I had to call to see if the camera had been ready for pick up. I had waited for two days called and then was told it had been ready. That's the only reason why I did not leave rate with a 5. My camera was perfect though! No more pesky spots and I would definitely return. Thank you!!!

Review 27: Came in Thursday just to pick up some filters, really like how Vincent was very patience on what I was looking for. Help me out with couple of portraits needs most definitely going back to buy my gear here.

Review 28: This shop is awesome! I got a medal framed picture and it turned out so cool!  I would use them again and I plan to!
5

Review 29: I'm a small business owner and my days can get crazy. I had a last minute photoshoot and had the photographer call and hold a backdrop for us. I got stuck at the shop later than planned so once I got on the road I called to let them know I was going to make it exactly at 5:30, their closing time. Esteban let me know he'd inform the closing staff. I arrived at George's and the doors were locked but I waived a young woman down. I told her that the backdrop was on hold and if I could quickly buy and leave. She said she'd ask. I watched her walk to the back and talk to the guys and they instead turned more lights off and started walking out. I begged (ya, begged) since I NEEDED this shoot done tonight. They said "nah, sorry. can't." I asked for a manager and apparently they leave early. When I gave up and got into my car it was exactly 5:33 pm. Not only did they close earlier than advertised but they were straight up rude. Go to Nelson's.

Review 30: Amazing service!!
A class act store!
Yes they had great things there but it's the great service that clearly defines this very special business in our own SD community!!!

Thanks again!!!
See you all soon!!

Review 31: Great service everytime I go there. They take the time to answer any questions you have which is perfect. I bought a camera battery there and after short while it just stopped holding power and they gave me a new one and made the whole process quick and easy. I'll always come here for any photography needs.
5

Review 32: Good place for all your camera needs, especially if you're in a pinch.  They carry everything a photographer needs, but my only gripe is the prices that compare to online services such as amazon.  Friendly and knowledgable individuals operating the storefront!
4

Review 33: I have been coming to this location sense it opened and I recently came back to the store to get some cameras cleaned and after having not been in the store for about a year. I was happy to see that some of the same friendly faces were still there. I had my cameras cleaned with no issues.
Thanks to Trevor and staff for always taking care of me.
5

Review 34: For the past 20+ yrs. I've seen so many of the same staff at George's.  They are friendly, experts in their field, and so helpful. Their prices are competitive to online camera stores, and best of all, I get to talk face to face with them and physically handle cameras and lenses that I'm considering buying.  Their rental department is also great. I highly recommend this camera store, especially now that there is one in Kearny Mesa which more convenient for me.
4

Review 35: If you are interested in photography and don't know where to start, this is the store for you. I recommend coming here because this is a specialized business. Every time I have come to the store, I was welcomed by the friendly and knowledgeable staff.

I honestly don't know too much about photography. I came in and spoke with Vincent. He was very knowledgeable on the different camera options, lighting, etc. He answered all of my questions and explained everything in a way that I could understand. He took his time with me step by step on explaining things that I needed to knowing order to operate a camera.

What I love about this camera store as well, I found out that they offer classes on site. That is something I will look forward to going to.

Parking is decent. There are parking lots in front and back of the building. There is also street parking.
5

Review 36: This store has everything you need from a hobbyist to professional productions. The staff is real knowledgeable of everything and will not steer you in the wrong direction. I am a big Sony Alpha mirrorless series fan. So Vince was my sales person and was great help since he's a Sony user himself. I recommend the getting the insurance for your purchase just in case anything happens to it (damage wise). He told me to get a different lens than what came in the bundle. But with his expert advice, we were able to customize the bundle. Don't think you can do that at a Best Buy or Frys. Oh and btw, they price match.

Review 37: I have been a professional photographer for 7 years. I have gone to countless camera stores up and down California. This is hands down my favorite shop. Every time I go in they remember me with my missing parts on My camera  everyone is so informative and nice. It's dangerous to go in there sometimes because I want to buy everything in the store  they have anything a photographers heart desires. This is the only location I get my camera cleaned and I get mine cleaned a lot due to heavy use. They always have it ready for me on my quick turn arounds. Look no where else for your camera store needs.

Review 38: I had great repair service at George's. I had dropped my lens and the filter frame took the impact and became bent and completely stuck on the lens. The folks at George's helped me right away, determined to get it off. After a few attempts by two different associates, they determined it needed to me cut off. Success was then achieved in a few short minutes. They asked for $20 for the assistance or, if I bought a new filter from them, the assistance was free. I bought a new filter, they cleaned my lens and put it on for me. It's as if the dropped lens incident never happened. I highly recommend them!
5

Review 39: I've been here 3 times and every time i have had an amazing experience. The first time i was running late for a flight about to miss it and needed to pick up gear and they made the process so fast and got me out on time to catch my flight (barely lol) and were so friendly in the process. The other times i dealt with Tim in the rental department and i tell ya that guy will just make your day every time you see him. If you're ever feeling down go chat with Jim. Customer service in on point and the gear always works amazing. 100% will be back to this place.

Review 40: The five stars are solely for the only person who acknowledged my presence in the store, a woman named Linda Moo. When I walked in, there was a group of men at the counter who clearly saw me waiting for their help but refused to say hello or even acknowledge my presence with a slight nod. I waited a few minutes for them to finish their conversation but it was rewarded with nothing. It reminded me of an old boys club where women don't exist nor are they deserving of any help. It appeared that all three men who worked there were just having a casual conversation with a male customer. I had to leave the group of men huddled behind the front counter and make my way to the rental area where Linda was waiting with a smile and eye contact for me. 

She was friendly, helpful, and engaged with the customers. If it weren't for her, this store would get a 1 star from me as everyone appeared to be disengaged and focused on other things except for the customer. Linda was knowledgeable and exact. If she didn't know the answer to my question, she was honest and referred another person. She walked me over to the film that was for my vintage Minolta Instant Pro, opened the box for me (even threw away the packaging for me) and waited until I tested out my camera for the "first" time. We then chatted about her photography and I inquired about head shots for my business. She's at <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Flindamoo.com&amp;s=4aa8dfb0eaa7d6b4d5ae7df024d93e0198148ae971dc6516b06311b1adc16330" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">lindamoo.com</a> (btw and you're welcome). I plan to contact her in the future for her services.  

I don't know who runs this store but the men could use sensitivity training in greeting their customers (all genders) within a few minutes of them walking into the store. And if three employees (who happen to be men) are behind the counter, at LEAST one person should acknowledge the customer waiting to be helped. Linda is the saving grace in this store and I'm so happy she was there to help me when I came in to patronize the old boys club. 

Ask for Linda if you're here. She's the best thing they got going on.

Review 41: I was help by the nicest man named Esteban .

Review 42: I am an amateur photographer and I was telling my Pro Friend about a trip to Ireland and I was taking my DSLR with Kit Lens.  He laughed at me and said I should check this place out and rent a nice lens for the trip.

I came here, got a nice lens for the trip the day before leaving and enjoyed every minute of having that nice piece of glass on my camera.

Overall the rental is easy, pick a lens, decide for how long, then put down your deposit. Keep in mind the deposit is the FULL PRICE OF THE LENS.  I think this is fair, but something you might not be expecting when you need to put a $2k deposit for a $20-100 rental. They mention that after 5 successful rentals that you do not need to do the deposit anymore.

I am so glad I found out about this place and will be renting more lenses from time to time, until I am able to make the investment to buy a nice lens of my own. 

I will be back!

Review 43: These guys are so helpful, and super nice . They also develop b&amp;w film ! They have everything you need and if you want a good deal on a used camera this is the place !
5

Review 44: Nice selection of camera gear and cameras.  Their are not many stand alone camera shops anymore where you can hold a camera and talk to someone before buying one.  Prices are a tad bit higher then online but you get to hold it before buying and walk out with it then and there.  

Staff has been friendly and helpful whenever I have stopped in.  

Parking is a tad better than their North Park location.  They have additional parking in the back.

 They do rentals which I have not utilized.  They do camera repair which I utilized and thought the price fair.  I got my camera back faster then their quoted time but it turned out to an easy fix.

Review 45: Had the lens my son was looking for at the same price he found online so we didn't have to wait. Very helpful salespeople. Made sure he tried it on his camera before making the sale.
5

Review 46: I bought 2 untested film cameras and wanted to get them checked. Walking in I got help right away from Patrick. He checked my film cameras (for free too:-) I was scared there was going to be a diagnosis fee) multiple times to see if they were working/making sure if they worked. He was also nice enough to inform me of the costs to fix and gave me a real opinion on what I should do next. I was really grateful because I felt like I wasn't getting scammed and Patrick was nice enough to give me all the information I needed. 

The other staff members were super cool too! As I was walking out, Jim made me feel super at home--  his smile literally is contagious (he didn't make me feel like a stranger but like a person or a friend) The person speaking with him (I forgot his name) was super nice too!  I guess what I'm trying to get at is this: go to George's camera to get your stuff fixed, to get the best service,and to meet real cool and genuine people.
5

Review 47: First time today...great people not pushy just helpful great variety of product and NO overpriced items before you buy online check this place out and if you shoot film they have you covered.
5

Review 48: They have a 15% restocking fee that's total BS. Received a Christmas gift I already had a duplicate of - tried to return it today brand new unopened and with receipt and the less than helpful man pointed out their fine print. Don't buy anything here unless you're 100% sure on keeping it cuz they'll charge you to walk it back and hang it on the shelf 5 feet away.  Awful customer service.

Review 49: My wife and I were in the market for a camera upgrade and went to George's. The salesperson spent a lot of time with us explaining the various benefits at different price points.

We eventually decided on a Nikon that will meet our needs for the foreseeabe future. We are elso geven free tickets to two classes for both of us.

I woudl strongly recomment them!
5

Review 50: My camera was front focussing and George's camera shop was amazing.  I was referred to them by a friend and was so happy with the results.  They fixed my camera and I had it back in two days.  They also showed me how to fix it myself the next time it happens.  Excellent service!
5

Review 51: I have rented from George's a few times and all went well. This 2 star rating is for a repair job we dropped off for them to handle. 

We dropped off two lenses for repair and after them having our lenses for over a month, didn't even get them repaired. The story is, after 30+ days I called to inquire on the lenses' status as we needed them for a job. We were told they would check with the repair guy. They called back a few days later to tell us that he had not repaired them and we could come pick them up. One of them, the repair guy didn't even have a camera body (Olympus 4/3) to test it on?! The other, a DJI 4/3 I guess he also could not test/repair. That would have been REALLY NICE TO KNOW prior to waiting over 30 days and not being able to have our lenses fixed for our job. 

They did refund our charges but when asked what happened, they just said they have no idea?! 

Definitely would not take another repair here, ever.

Review 52: Heard good things so I drove the 15 miles to go and look for flash systems and hardware.  Just learning so I wanted to take some time to ask questions and get advice.   Went in and waited over 25 minutes looking around and nobody even looked up or acknowledged me.  Must have walked from the front to back of the store 6 times and nobody even asked me if I needed help or said they would be a few minutes.  
Will not be returning.

Review 53: Baffled by any good review i see. These guys are the absolute worst.  I've been into George's Camera maybe 5 times. Each time was a nightmare.  Last time I went to George's.  I bring in a couple rolls of film to get developed. I go to Nelson's photo in Point Loma regularly but I work right down the road and figured' they can't mess up film right? So I go in. And wait around at the register for a few minutes.  Finally, this man who was sitting on a stool reading a magazine, oblivious to any customers, gets up and asks if I had any questions. I tell him I need some film developed. He says "sure we can do that." So I give him my film, he takes my information and gives me a price (more expensive than Nelson photo). And after he charges my debit card and hands me a receipt he says "we'll get it back in about a week" - not when he said "sure we can do that" I thought he literally meant he could develop my film. But instead, they actually send their film out for developing. Nelson's photo takes just a few hours and gets your film back cheaper, they don't lie and they provide amazing customer service.   I highly recommend not going to any George's Camera location.  If you need a recommendation go to Nelson's photo supplies. As a returning customer, I have never been disappointed. I actually always walk out with a smile on my face. George and his crew are going to let you down.

Review 54: Jay at the counter at George's Camera was super helpful. It turned out I didn't making a purchase today but I will be back when I'm ready!!

Review 55: I bought a hgx prime UV filter and was told there is a drop protection warranty.  This was a major reason I chose that filter.  

After several months the filter cracked. I tried to return the filter and get a replacement under the warranty.  However I was told that my filter does not have a warranty.  The filter with the warranty is a different type of filter that they sell.  

If the staff initially told me correct information on the filters I would have purchased the one that actually had the warranty and would not have had to buy a replacement.

Review 56: The people here are awesome. They've always been friendly and accommodating. I used to live 45 mins away and made the trip because they are that good.

Review 57: Staff very helpful. Everything's in store overpriced but good quality, great place to rent a lenses.

Review 58: Georges camera is great! Ive rented gear from there many times to great success. I also recently brought in a film camera, not expecting to find the batteries i needed but hoping to learn something. I think his names was Trevor? He helped get me the film and batteries i needed and took the time to show me how everything worked. Super grateful for his attention and their service in general.

Review 59: My dad came from the east coast and wanted to try out a lens while we visited some places. I called George's and made arrangements to pick up a lens. I could not have been happier by the courtesy, friendliness, and knowledge of the staff. My dad raved about how nice it was there and how he wished there was a place like this where he lives. Go there. They will help you and will not make you feel like a fool.

Review 60: First time to George's. My Nikon 24-120 VR failed. I sent it to Nikon under warranty. After 10 days with out even hearing from them I went to Georg's  to rent a lens. The one I wanted was already rented out. I met Patrick in the Rental department who was very helpful. He suggested a Tamron 15-30 and was knowledgeable about it. I wasn't sure about Tamron as I have always been Nikon. Because I was only renting it for a week I gave it a try. I was so impressed with it, I told Patrick I would buy it if he could match all the other deals from B&amp;H, Amazon ETC; He did, I felt good buying it local. Thank You for all your Help Patrick...

Review 61: Great customer service!  Daniel was attentive to my questions and showed me a couple of cameras that would meet my needs.  He also informed me of the store's rental policy for my consideration.  So glad that I visited the store - I can now make a more informed decision!
5

Review 62: Due to difficulties I was having shooting pictures, I brought a Nikon D80 with a zoom lens into George's Camera.  Immediately, I was greeted by Patrick who diagnosed the issue.  Apparently, the aperture blades on the lens were broken but the body of the camera was OK.  Patrick provided excellent advice and service.  I asked if I could see alternative cameras that I might consider purchasing such as the Nikon D5600.  Patrick fully explained the features of the camera and discussed alternatives to my Nikon D80.  Upon discussing these, I decided to purchase the new camera.  If you need any assistance with a camera or a camera purchase, go to George's instead of the online retailers or big box stores.  Individuals such as Patrick have deep expertise in photography and are always willing to assist you.  I am throughly satisfied with my camera purchase and highly recommend Patrick and other staff at George's Camera.  They really care about providing superior customer service.
5

Review 63: George's Camera, specifically Mark, is the reason I chose to purchase a high end camera from a local bricks and mortar store than through an internet retailer. I spent 5 hours over 2 visits to investigate which camera and lenses to purchase and learn about the features of the cameras I was interested in.  I never felt rushed. Mark even suggested a cheaper camera (than I bought) to meet my needs. He was not just a salesman but a partner in trying to show me features of each camera so that I could make the best choice. It turned out I bought the more expensive, professional camera because of a Nikon sale which made more sense to buy the Nikon D500 rather than the Nikon D7500 which just came out the day before. 

The main issue I want to underline is that when I am going to spend a lot of money on something, service becomes a big factor. The time spent at the store was enjoyable and priceless. They meet the on line prices from another state as well. Reading posts from others with horror stories about purchases from reputable places made my decision easier as well. Ask for Mark!!!

Review 64: I walked in here to see if I could get a camera lens fixed that had not been working for a while. I didn't get the name of the person who looked at my lens, but he was so friendly! He took his time testing out my lens and examining it to see if there was anything wrong with it. The problem I was originally having seemed to not be there when he looked at it, but he was nice about it anyways. He told me the part where the filter was attached was broken but I didn't need to get it fixed unless I wanted to attach a UV filter. I feel like most people would have milked me for money at one little part that was broken, but he told me it wasn't necessary to get it fixed. This place is great and super helpful! You don't feel intimidated if you don't know much about photography.

Review 65: Larry was awesome and really helpful! I will for sure be back here in the future. I recommend to everyone. Thank you.

Review 66: I don't go here too often, as I don't need to buy much more gear. When I do go, I'm always very happy with the quick and thorough help from the staff. They're so knowledgeable about lighting and photography. It helps a ton!

The rentals department is great. They're quick and the prices are competitive with online rentals. 

Store is always clean and the parking is so easy. Great local camera shop!
5

Review 67: This place is my go to photography store in San Diego.  A step above all the rest.  Coming from a customer service background, this place is top notch.  They remember your name and remember what you last bought, and offer great suggestions without being pushy or put off by questions.  The rental department is really great as well, very reliable and they have alot of gear!  Stand out empoyees: Pat! Larry! Linda! Jim!  The only camera store I go to. Thanks for all of the support Georges!

Review 68: Your experience may vary on who's working the sales counter. I came in once where the woman working the sales counter was great, helpful, and nice. Same trip the guy working the rental department was also great. My most recent trip, I wanted to get some information regarding Sony lenses and cameras and the old guy working the sales counter was preoccupied with phone to be bothered to help me. By the time, I got his attention for a moment, I asked to see a lens along with a body. He let me see the lens, but not the body and said it would be a moment. What am I supposed to do with half of a setup?  Then when he finally got off the phone, he just put the lens back and started helping someone else. I got fed up with that nonsense and left. I was planning on picking up a lens or two, but the service was terrible and so is their selection of gear. So much for supporting your local photo store.

Review 69: I've been coming here for all my rental needs for about 2 years now. Jim takes SUPER good care of me...great, friendly guy with an immense amount of photography and equipment knowledge. I don't go anywhere else! I even purchased a camera from here recently and once again took care of me! Threw in a bunch of coupons for rental credit, camera maintenance and cleaning, etc.  and gave me an amazing deal. I would trust this place head and shoulder above anyone else for questions and equipment needs. Love George's Camera!!! Did I mention I travel about 45 mins to come here? WORTH IT!!!

Review 70: Love how close this location is to my house. Used to go to the one in North Park. Although, the employees are way nicer at the other location. I would have given this place 5 stars, but every time I come here no one acknowledges me and I always have to get someone's attention. Other then that, they have a lot of good products. Just wish they were a bit friendlier.

Review 71: Great local photography shop!! I came in to purchase a seamless paper backdrop for the first time. Trevor was quick to assist me and found the exact color I wanted. When I was concerned about the length of the box fitting into my sedan, he helped put it into my car. Great service and selection. I'll definitely be coming back!!

Review 72: The service was amazing, David helped me pick out exactly what I was looking for. He made the purchase a snap. Come by and give these guys a try, you won't be sorry.

Review 73: Just had the most amazing service experience here. Patrick is the most helpful person I've ever encountered in any store. They don't just want to sell you things- they want to help you be a better photographer. They give you the information you need and let you make the decisions for yourself.

Now for the details:

Patrick was so professional and knowledgeable about both my Sony digital camera and my Nikon D3100. I brought both in for them to look at and give me an idea of how much it might cost to repair. 

They have a camera repairman who charges $10/camera to give a repair estimate and usually takes a week. During the holidays, it can take longer. He comes and picks up the cameras and then repairs/looks them over elsewhere. 

My Sony digital camera had been dropped and the lens wasn't coming out of the body every time I turned it on (a hit or miss issue). It's a slightly higher end Sony and patrick had seen another similar camera come in last weekend and the repairs for that one was around $280-$300. Apparently the lens parts for the Sony could only be purchased through one company in Chicago and they're expensive and sometimes out of stock- so it takes longer to repair. Patrick gave us all the information we needed on the repairs and also looked up new camera prices for us in case we wanted to just buy a new one. If you buy through them, George's camera offers a 3yr comprehensive coverage warranty that covers drops and 1 replacement among other things for $120. 

As for my Nikon D3100, I've been getting an autoexposure error. Patrick looked at it and tested out some pictures and was able to tell me that my metering was way off. He didn't know what the exact problem was because it's not a common problem for dslrs and told me it would most likely be very expensive to repair (not worth it). He said it still functioned fine manually, which I didn't realize, and suggested I use it as a learner camera. 

I was very happy with the level of service I received and loved that they didn't try to push any services or cleanings or products on me. That actually made me more inclined to buy from them in the future! I highly recommend coming to them for help with your camera - whether it be mechanics or shooting, there will be someone there who can help you out.

Review 74: I'm not a professional photographer, I've dabbed here and there but could never talk shop with the big dogs. At first I was a little intimidated to go in there but David promptly greeted me and began helping me out, I explained my needs and what I was looking for, he was just so friendly, helpful and patient.

With such a great selection of products, I'm sure this place is great for professional photographers, but I can't highlight it enough, that is great for novices like myself too. The knowledgeable, friendly and patient staff will make your camera (accessory) buying experience truly great! 

David explained everything to me in a whole new way that I was actually able to understand, I've taken photography classes before, but he somehow managed to provide me with a deeper understanding in just a few minutes than in all of my photography experience combined.

David was really great about being honest with me and not trying to up sell me on something that I didn't need. I'm so satisfied with my purchase!! 

I bought the Sony a6300 and it came with a bunch of goodies, it came with two vouchers for camera classes: one for Sony cameras and one for my specific camera, it also came with a $40 camera equipment rental credit.

After my purchase I made sure to "like" George's Camera on Facebook and am so glad I did. I saw a promotion for a lens rental if you rent it on the day before Thanksgiving for a one day rental you get to keep it through the weekend and return it on Monday at no extra charge. 

I took my rental voucher in and had an idea of what I wanted, but again, didn't fully understand the lenses and how they all worked or what specifically I wanted or needed, the woman behind the counter ( I didn't catch her name) was absolutely amazing she was so patient an knowledgeable, she really took her time explaining everything to me and helping me choose the right lenses for my needs.

Review 75: Love this local resource! I have a shoot tomorrow and while checking my CF Card found one was fried. I called George's Kearny Mesa location and spoke to a very helpful employee, Patrick. He went above and beyond to find me a replacement card. I really appreciate it! Highly recommend them!

Review 76: Great staff! They help you understand your camera and its capabilities without making you feel dumb.

Review 77: Such great staff! Went to Best Buy and they had a small section of camera Plus the staff didn't seem to know much about cameras. Decided to go to georges and thank goodness we ran into David! He was very knowledgeable and helpful! Got the perfect camera for our new photo and video sessions! Thanks David!

Review 78: We were in town from az On labor day weekend at my daughters soccer tournament. I needed a better stick to film the game. In between games I located this store on yelp. Awesome service. Very helpful and good prices. I did not want to spend too much on a stick and they honored my request finding the best option. Very impressed with their customer service and great prices. They had me out the door and back to the game in less than 30 minutes! I think the person who helped me was Jim. Also gave me great asian food restaurant suggestions too! Thank you for being honest and not selling me something i did not need. Huge respect for the integrity of this store!

Review 79: I would really give a 4.5 but don't want to give a lower average.  LOL. Anyway, I won't lie that I  don't get most of my stuff on Amazon, but George's is my go to locally when I need somethimg ASAP.  They are usually (95%) very knoweable about what I looking for.  I always call ahead of time and the item is waiting for me when I come in and make the trip fast.  Thanks.

Review 80: Good service and staff have excellent product knowledge. I returned a broken tripod with no questions asked and they replaced it. 
Also good range of inventory and a great rental department!
Highly Recommended for Amateur and Pro's!

Review 81: JIM IS THE MAN! This was our first time renting equipment at George's camera. Jim gave us a lot of knowledge on all the equipment. I really appreciate the time he took to help us. We will be back forever!
5

Review 82: I brought my Nikon SLR into Ken's today as I couldn't seem to get it to power up to take pictures, figuring that it would require a major repair.  Linda greeted me as soon as I walked in and quickly determined what the problem was. I was expecting that a major repair might be required. She noted that a memory card was not in place and simply made an adjustment on the screen and the camera fired up again. I needed a new charger which set me back only $60. I was very happy the speed, honesty and competency encountered at Ken's Camera's. I will be back and highly recommend them to anyone who owns or needs to rent a camera!
5

Review 83: What a great place!  And a reminder why local business matters:  quality, expertise, service, and an all around good experience.  I bought my camera elsewhere and took it to George's for a repair estimate.  They sent it out and the estimate was free.  Ultimately, I decided the camera wasn't worth the repair expense.  But the whole time - even after they knew they were making $0 off of me - they treated me like a customer should be treated, and even offered me free advice on how to continue using my camera with its limited functionality.  Patrick also kept me reliably updated via email throughout the estimate process.  Next time you need a camera or anything camera-related, go to George's and remind yourself how truly special it is not to have to send an email, be placed on hold, and just to talk to friendly, knowledgeable people face-to-face.

Review 84: There are very few bargains here. Maybe on pre owned lenses but I didn't look at the prices sorry. All other items are good quality but expensive. Yes camera equipment it expensive but this store offers no discount for the bargain hunter. 60 dollars for the 5in 1 reflector. Little selection of new lenses and even less selection of DSLR cameras ... In a camera store. I'll be looking for a better camera store in the San Diego area. Sammys I hear is good.

Review 85: Incredibly helpful staff across the board - rentals and sales. Love this place and I can't wait to come check it out again. They really helped the project I was working on, and I'm stoked on my new gear I got there.
5

Review 86: The staff always talks to me with a tone of superiority. When I asked about switching from Canon to Nikon I received very short answers. The showroom was dead at the time as well.

Review 87: Favorite camera store in San Diego. Super knowledgeable and friendly staff!
5

Review 88: Walked in with my camera that's been broken for some time now. They were honest and didn't mind telling me I was better off just replacing the whole camera since its older. I appreciate honesty! Can't wait to go back and get all the stuff I want from there!
5

Review 89: First of all I'd like to take notice to Jim, James, Jimbo, Jimmy, whatever you want to call him! He's the rent guy! Amazing associate and very fun! He's got great energy and is awesome at what he does. He totally helped me out on what it was I was shooting. Rented a lens from him and of course will come back again! He's awesome! You may want to bring a green juice to get on his better side! I know I will for now on! Thank again Jim!

Review 90: I haven't shopped here yet, but I did go in for a repair on my camera, a Fujifilm mirrorless interchangeable lens camera. Patrick called me after their technician inspected it and said it was a bad power supply, and he let me know that the repair would be expensive, but that Fujifilm might cover it even though it was outside the warranty period. In fact, he even offered to get me the serial number so I could inquire with Fujifilm, and he followed up on that with an email right away.

So I'm going to send it in to the manufacturer; Fujifilm hasn't promised to cover it, but it could potentially save me a few hundred dollars.

I appreciate George's Camera spending time trying to do the right by me rather than choosing to make a few bucks. They will certainly get my business in the future!
5

Review 91: Staff are great &amp; they carry great products in stock with a very friendly return policy. I bought a rode mic pro here a few months ago at a great price...it is excellent. Also, the staff will give one on one help with products!
Great place

Review 92: Expert Staff and Amazing service at George's Camera !!!   
I wanted to thank Patrick O'Dell for his help and responding and forwarding a question to his co-worker Larry McDaniel who is truly a very kind, courteous helping knowledgeable veteran professional at Georges, and one that needs to be recognized as going above and beyond and the extra mile to help the customer such as myself to solve any kind of problem they may have in the photography business whether it be with cameras gear or advice. I wasn't expecting Larry to respond to my question inquiry over the weekend especially on a Sunday, but I was grateful and thrilled that I received a response so quickly, That is Amazing Service!!!

Larry responded on a Sunday, (which is truly amazing!!!)  and let me know to bring in the receiver module and the strobe head for him to take a look at. I was not expecting to get a response so soon and figured out that I would get a response on Monday or maybe sometime later.  I had purchased a Bowen's pocket wizard receiver module at Georges Camera  a week or so ago, and had purchased the Bowen's Gemini 500 pro strobe head approximately 3 weeks previous (at another retail outlet).  

Once I brought the strobe down with the pocket wizard receiver module for Larry to take a look at, he had an immediate sense of what was happening.  He noticed that the board in the strobe, was angled slightly downward and to the left ever so slightly which did not allow the receiver module to easily slip in.  Larry tried another receiver module from the backroom and ended up with the same result.  Receiver module would just not go in.  

Then Larry applied his magic touch inserting the module downward and angled to the left and before you know it, there was a "click" and the module guided by Larry's fingertips correctly went into the strobe receiver slot.  He did a quick test with a pocket wizard, and the strobe fired like a champ.   I felt a huge sigh of relief as this was my last try before contacting Bowen's the manufacturer about the problem. And we all know the routine.  Box it up, ship it back, hope nothing gets broken along the way incur shipping charges, wait, get the item back and check it out and hope the problem is fixed.  A lot of time can be lost by going through this route. 

Since I reside in Oceanside  and have a daily drive to Irvine amounting to 55 miles one way
and knowing that from Oceanside to Georges Camera in Clairmont Mesa is another lengthy drive in itself (just the opposite direction)  there was  something very professional and knowledgeable that came through in our conversation that demonstrated years and years of experience in the camera business only someone such as Larry would know. So after talking with Larry, I decided to drive down after work from Irvine  and visit with Larry and see what he could do. 

And the rest of the story is history, Larry was able to insert the module into the strobe, and test it  to ensure it worked properly and and then I was on my way.   The entire process was no longer than 10 minutes.  And yes I plan to leave the receiver module in the strobe since I only use Bowen's equipment at this time. If I should choose to use other equipment in the future, I will purchase additional pocket wizard units. 

Larry is truly a very kind helping professional at Georges, and one that needs to be recognized who goes above and beyond and the extra mile to help the customer such as myself to solve their problems.   Without Larry's expertise and know-how I would have ended up contacting Bowen's and sending the strobe unit back, and then incurring the long wait and shipping expense. The installation was achieved in minutes, and I am truly a very happy customer. 

I am a customer for life at George's.  

Larry is truly Amazing !!  Amazing Staff and service at Georges Camera

Review 93: I hired my first camera body and they really took care of me. Totally working working with my needs, were super understanding and patient. Best customer service I've experienced. Definitely the place to go for processing film, printing needs, and rentals! Not to mention their range of camera equipment.
5

Review 94: At both locations, the service was great for the purchase of the camera and for accessories that we rented.  The prices couldn't be beat.  Everyone was helpful, friendly and super fun.  Wouldn't go anywhere else - they are the best!

Review 95: George's is great! Friendly service, great inventory, they have everything you need and GREAT classes, too!

Review 96: As a new photographer, I don't have all the equipment and necessities I need. George's camera was referred to me by another camera store when they didn't have the equipment I was looking to rent. The people at George's camera were so kind to me. I called 2 different times to talk with the rental department and what equipment I would need to have a successful shoot and each time they were more than helpful. When I finally made it to the store to rent the equipment, Jim (fingers crossed I am remembering his name correctly) was so nice and encouraging as I was slightly intimidated. I had a wonderful shoot and returned the equipment the next day. Jim remembered me and asked the outcome of my shoot and was so happy I was successful. I also had my one year old with me and he was more than happy to answer my questions while I was multitasking at keeping my child happy. What a wonderful experience! I will continue to rent and buy from them!!!
5

Review 97: Always held this shop in high regard, but not anymore.  I took my camera here for a lens repair/replacement and they sent it out to another shop. The lens was replaced but the camera won't focus. Took it back and the shop they sent it out to didn't want to honor their warranty. After some time they sent it out again and called me and said it was fixed. It wasn't. I paid over $160 for shoddy repairs and my camera won't focus. Never shopping here again. Beware-take your camera somewhere else for repairs.

Review 98: I've been coming to George's Camera Shop on Clairemont Mesa Blvd. for sometime. I've  always been welcomed with open arms, and anytime I've needed to rent camera equipment, Jimmy has always been there to help and lend a hand. I feel George's Camera Shop is great. I would recommended to anyone who is in need of expert advice, and or someone who is looking to take their skill  set to the next level with the quality products they have at this location. If you are looking to buy, rent, or ask for help I would recommend speaking with Jimmy. 5 stars for top notch quality service. Thanks guys!!!!

Review 99: I'm not a photographer - but work with many and sometimes need to rent equipment. Hunting around I found that George's was the place. In business for over 50 years, plus this additional location - Camera nerds agree - George's is the local's choice. 

A round of applause for Jim at the rental counter - not only is he funny and friendly, he seriously knows his stuff. For a novice like me who simple researched what I think I might need but wasn't sure - he was a godsend and guided me to a package that fit my needs. The price was right - but note, the deposits required are usually about what it would cost to buy the equipment ( i.e., great rental price, but they hold a couple thousand on your credit card just in case. They have to! This stuff is pricey! Just be sure you've got the room on your plastic for it) 

Returning my rentals was just as pleasant as researching and picking them up was - Jim was there again and a other staff members check my return and tested the equipment and send me on my way. 

Loads of supplies - everything from backdrops to stands to lights to recording equipment plus of course, cameras. 

Knowlegable staff gets A+++

Review 100: FIRST IMPRESSIONS
Big, open, clean, and full of friendly and educated staff. It's a photographer's playground. (I just wish I had the money to drop on some of the toys they have.)

THE GEAR
George's stocks nearly everything the first party brands have available, and if they don't, they can get it easily. They also have a plethora of comparable third party fear that can help take your photo/video game up a few levels.

THE SERVICES
George's also has a full rental shop in the back, they offer printing services, and also host workshops on the regular. Again: it's a photographer's playground!

THE VERDICT
We all know photo gear gets expensive, especially when you don't understand why. But the team here will help guide you to the right purchase for your gig and level of understanding. They're not looking just for sales; they're looking for consistent repeat customers. And I'm happy to say they have a new one in me. Thanks gang!

Review 101: Rental and Repair dept.

As a professional photographer there is a major lack of a quality photography store here in San Diego. But Georges has filled that gap very well. I can rely on getting most of the things I need done locally at reasonable prices. Also they have a great rental and repair department. I had a old discounted Cannon L lens and they where able to repair it. I would highly recommend
5

Review 102: Rental Department Specific...

Aside from the vast selection of rental equipment, the place is staffed with some top-tier folks who are not only knowledgeable, but extremely flexible and courteous. I've heard so many horror stories about rental businesses with strict rules and robotic management - but George's goes against the grain by offering an expressly human and hospitable experience that made me feel like I was a long-time customer. Can't wait to rent again!
5

Review 103: This review is particularly for the rental department. The staff is always friendly and helpful, but today they went above and beyond to show not only wonderful customer service, but an incredible amount of kindness as well. 

You guys made me cry.. Seriously I had tears in my eyes my entire drive home, and I'm still choked up as I write this review. I can't thank you enough for such a sweet gesture during such a hard time. You have no idea how much this meant to me! 

I will continue to rent here always, and use them for any and all of my camera needs! 

I wish I wasn't so awful with names, so that I could thank them by name for being so sweet today, when they did not have to be!

Thank you so much guys!

Review 104: Linda was awesome helping me out. I was looking for a particular item and they had it.  They let me take it for a spin and didn't pressure me into making an expensive purchase.  Photo shoots, action, professional or recreational needs.  George's has it covered.  Got to try some different gear for some up coming projects.  They close 5:30 pm so plan accordingly if you're going to make the drive out.

Review 105: Super friendly and knowledgeable staff. Excellent service and prices. Highly recommended.

Review 106: Horrible and humiliating customer service. I called in to make a reservation for a camera lens and the sales associate was being rude and making fun of me for not knowing their policies. I recommend hiring a new set of employees for this is very unprofessional for a business.
1

Review 107: Love this place!

I run a marketing firm and we use George's frequently. Whether I'm buying or renting George's has really great customer service and the've been very flexible with us. 

Special shout-out to Larry and Jim. I've probably received thousands of dollars of advice/consulting from these two and there's never a sales push, just sound advice. It's nice to shop somewhere where you feel like your business is appreciated and for that reason I'll sometimes buy from George's even when I find a better deal online. 

Five Stars*****

Review 108: I love being able to walk into a camera store and talk to experts who can steer me the right way without trying to sell me the greatest and most expensive.  

I feel very lucky to have such helpful experts there to help me hands on - you can't get that from the web and trust me, I've tried.  Most of their prices match the web and for those things that are a tad more, it's worth it to me to get this type of service.

I've gone to both George's over the years and have alway received excellent service by knowledgable employees who took their time explaining features and helping me make a decision.

And they didn't fail me when the weight-bearing hook on my tripod went missing.  I stopped by their new Clairemont Mesa location and placed an order for a replacement hook. They called me when it came in and left me a message; I went in ten days later (crazy week) to pick it up.  They had a hard time locating it, but when they did, they gave it to me for free!  It was on a defective item.  I couldn't believe it...

I trust these guys - they've earned my business over and over.

Review 109: Needed a 430 ex II last minute. Called, placed on hold, it was there when I arrived. Friendly service, quick checkout, and my item was there when I expected it to be. Can't ask for much more.
5

Review 110: love this place. I have rented from here a couple of times. Reasonably priced. Jim is friendly and very helpful in helping me decide what I wanted to rent. Will definitely come here again.
5

Review 111: I have always used George's because of their great customer service and product selection. I just returned my equipment that is in better shape then when I received. As returning everything I was told that the Tripod Collar's screw came loose. Therefore, there is a $25 charge for the repair. 

I will never use this shop again and you should not either, unless you want to get ripped off.
1

Review 112: Miguel, you're funny.  Maybe the fact the place is so big makes it look spacious.  I'm a pro and I found a lot to check out.  Nothing wrong with bags.  I've been going to Georges for years (support your local store so you have one) and Georges has evolved into a good store.  If someone doesn't have the answer someone else will.  The day of acting elitist and condescending is gone.  If they don't have something ask, maybe the other store has it and can get it to you.  Guess I'm just glad it's closer to the north county and has parking.
5

Review 113: An old Calumet regular who is just happy to say; I found Jim!  Read my Calumet  review to know why that is so fantastic!  It's now worth the drive from Fallbrook to rent from George's.
5

Review 114: Recently visited the Clairemont Mesa Blvd store and was very pleased with the friendly service and helpful associates.  Coincidentally when I returned to the store for the second time to purchase another lens, the same sales associate, Casey, was there to answer all of my questions.  
She took her time with me since I am a novice, and explained everything very thoroughly to me.  After visiting the camera department at Best Buy, George's Camera was like a breath of fresh air!
5

Review 115: Stoked I don't have to head downtown for a decent camera store. I live in North County and now we have nothing. The employees seem well informed. The store is small, but well stocked for pro level gear &amp; down. They have a good selection of rental gear too.
5

Review 116: I'm so glad they opened this location.  Parking (pro tip: there's more in the back) makes it worth the trip. Staff is about as knowledgeable as you would expect from a camera store.  The only reason why they don't get a five from me is because they are a little more expensive than online store.

Excellent service.

Review 117: Love renting lens from this place. Keisha is very helpful with explaining rental rules and even gives advice on what type of lenses are best based on the shoot you are doing.  

Happy that they opened a location in Kearny Mesa. Plenty of park (secret - drive to the back of the building --there's a 2ns entrance back there.)

Review for Fromex Photo:
Review 1: Found this place online! Easy to spot and lots of parking!

I needed to print wedding photos that were really high quality for a parent album. Immediately upon walking in, I was greeted. One gentlemen even sat down and helped me upload my photos and answered all my questions! The service here is great! I really appreciated him taking the time to sit down and look at my photos and file size and give me his honest opinion! He also informed me that I couldve done everything online!

The pictures were ready in 24hrs but you can pay to have them printed faster. I print 266 photos for $86!!!!!!!!! I was blown away by the price. I had called for quotes from other places and they charged $1.10 per 4x6 print. This place charges less the more you print so I spent about 30cents per print 

The quality of these photos was incredible.  I am beyond satisfied with the service and product I recieved. 

I drive 20mins to Fromex and back and it was 100% worth it. I cannot wait to use this place for my photography needs!

Thank you so much!!!!!
5

Review 2: 21 star customer service every time I go there. Their photo enlargement is clear this is the best place to have any photos enlarged and matted
5

Review 3: Fast service, good prices, and friendly, understanding service! I got my photos printed at the time in only 10 minutes and the employees explained everything clearly and well and I really felt like I got the best deal for what I paid and what I got.
5

Review 4: I you want a passport photo don't bother!!! 

These clowns can't do the most basic functions of fitting a photo into a 2 inch frame.  I brought in a perfect image that was professionally taken and cropped with a blank (photo shopped) background.  They uploaded it into their worthless system and couldn't move it 1 MILLIMETER to make it fit inside the frame, and would NOT EVEN TRY to come up with a solution.  What kind of print shop can't do basic Microsoft paint level photo adjustments??  

The only reason I even bothered with this crap hole is because it's blocks from my house.  Next time I will take the drive to a REAL PHOTO LAB.

Review 5: I took an old photograph of my grandfather, a WWII vet and had it restored from it's poor state to its' original glory.  Friendly staff and quick service. I will be back again for my other printing needs.

Review 6: I absolutely loved the service here!! I went in last Friday to get a picture restored, as part of my husband's father's day present. Of course it was last minute, so I wasn't holding my breath for dame day service!! Maria was awesome!! She made sure I was completely happy with the picture restoration. She even added the name on the picture. I walked in, requested what I wanted, and picked it up after work. It was exactly what I wanted, and very inexpensive for the excellent service I received. Definitely recommend this place, and I will be returning!!!

Review 7: I wanted to print my pictures from my trip in Europe to put in a scrap book and I found Fromex on google and checked them out on Yelp. At first I just printed a few pictures to see the quality and when I picked them up they were so amazing I just had to order the rest of my pictures right away! I forgot the name of the guy who was there helping me out but he was nice and friendly and he showed me the scrapbook option instead of printing all my pictures in a 4x6 size. I just picked my order today and they look really great! I still have a few more prints to order and now I'm thinking if I should re-print my pictures from my other trip! It's really hard to find a place that prints good quality pictures these days and finding this place makes me feel I hit the jackpot! Thanks Fromex!
5

Review 8: Friendly and quick service. Quality headshot prints ($1.85 each x's minimum 10). However, they print any type of photograph. Nice!
5

Review 9: Maria is awesome! She does everything to perfection and very quick service. Thanks again and I will most definitely be coming back!
5

Review 10: I was looking forward to giving the place a shot due to other good ratings . Yelp usually never lets me down but the lady at the counter was pretty rude . As soon as I came in she gave a look like I was of inconvenience to her . When I asked for help about getting a passport photo done for my boards she was rude and not helpful whatsoever, making a snarty face and smirk . No thank you ! So I left .
1

Review 11: I don't know what I would have done if it wasn't for Maria. Once again she saves the day always takes my orders and gets them done with perfection and most times same day service. She's always there with a friendly smile gives great customer service. She is the reason why I continue to go there . it's always nice to have a local place to count on.

Review 12: I was in a rush to get shower invitations printed and in desperate need of a local printer, stumbled across them online and so glad I did. They printed shower invites, thank you cards and another item for me with very quick turnaround time and they looked amazing on Pearl White Linen paper. Already received compliments on the invites. Found all of their staff on the phone and in person to be great. The easy uploader was quick and easy and received emails when the jobs were done. Highly recommend them. Their printing for photos/canvas looks amazing as well.
5

Review 13: Had pictures of my kids taken at one of the places at the mall. I bought a package with the CD. Needed more prints for family this weekend and they wanted to charge me $18 a sheet! I found this place online. The order was ready in 24 hours. The prices are comparable to the drug stores (and much cheaper than the place that took the pictures) but the quality and the service is leaps and bounds above the stores. I will never use the drug stores or any other place again!
5

Review 14: I spent 2 hours here with my fiancé trying to get our save the dates edited and printed off. I didn't even get the guy's name but he was so patient with us and allowed us to use Adobe Photoshop. Luckily we were able to get it the way we wanted it to. He made a few fixes and they were printed out perfectly within an hour! Thank you guys so much!
5

Review 15: You can't beat their service. I have been using their services for years. Great prices and great quality and great turnaround.
5

Review 16: I've been a commercial photography hack for 30 years, and rarely make prints. I have a small wall in the studio for personal snapshots and I always use Fromex. Nice folks, they understand the business and always work hard to be sure my work is printed and mounted properly.

The ROES system works well, and if I (or they) have any questions, their service and attitude on the phone is excellent.

My highest recommendation.

Review 17: Like a typical guy, I waited until the day before valentine's day to remember that my someone special wanted some really nice prints of us together.  So at 2pm...on the 13th...I began searching for a place that could do good prints quick.  I looked at some 1-hour photo places like Walmart and other retailers but none could do larger 11x14 prints.  I found this place through my trusty wingman through all this (Google) and went on their website.  Used the ROES tool and in a matter of minutes, my order was placed.  I didn't specify "Rush" for the extra $5, but put a note on the order pleading my desperation for quick prints. 
Not even 2 hours later, I get a confirmation Email that the order was complete ... Could it be that quick?  Maybe it just meant the order was completely received, processing?  I was skeptical.  Then my phone rings.  The order was ready for pickup.  I hauled-a** over there (within legal speed limits of course) and paid a very reasonable rate and was really amazed with how great the prints look.  I opted for the Fuji Pearl finish, which gave elements of the image a very professional, metallic sheen to them.
Overall, a wonderful experience.  Great quality, fair pricing, super quick turnaround.  And, I'm not sure if the "lady behind the counter" is the same as ones others have referenced in their reviews, but the counter person was polite, friendly, and capped off a great experience.

Review 18: I took some Xmas pictures here to have them enlarged for my wife for a present. First they helped me size them on their computer and made sure everything looked right. They told me it would be a 2 day turn around which seemed good compared to a few places I called around the holidays. When I went to pick the photos up they were not ready because their printer had broke the day prior. I was a little annoyed because had driven quite a ways but figured I should have called first, and it really was not their fault the printer broke.  When I came in the next day to get my pics they again apologized for the delay, and only made me pay for half of my order. I thought this was impressive because I really didn't even complain about them not making the deadline. It seems to me they really understand what good customer service is supposed to be about. I will definely be a returning customer. The pictures came out great too!!!!!

Review 19: The prints here are great and you can't find a print shop in town with a faster turn around... But the lady at the front desk is AWFUL!! And thats putting it politely. She is not helpful, rude and unapologetic. 

I have used Fromex several times to print invitations and like I said, their turn around is great (sometimes, even same day). But no short turn around is worth the terrible front desk lady...

The straw that broke the camels back was when I recently printed a shower invitation at Fromex. When I went to pick them up, the women was more unpleasant then ever. When she finally handed me the invitations, I realized that they had been printed incorrectly (the front and back were printed different directions). I politely commented on the incorrect printing, and she responded by saying something like, "Well, thats the way you ordered them". I told her they were defiantly not ordered facing two different directions and asked her if she was the one who processed the order. She told me she was not... so how do you know that was the way if was ordered? She offered me no consolation... she didn't even offer to reprint them.

Needless to say, I am not a fan. I would not recommend them to anyone unless its an emergency and you need something printed in less then a day. Because lets be honest if it's an emergency... you are probably not going to be upset that they are printed upside-down.

Review 20: I needed a place to take my passport photo at, and I found this place on yelp. If it wasn't for the good reviews, I'd probably wouldn't even step foot in here. Honestly it looks pretty sketchy outside. But the workers were very nice. Customer service was great. While waiting for the woman who took my photo to fix the flash on her dslr I was looking around and I saw some pretty amazing photos that were taken. I probably wouldn't mind getting other photos done here.

Review 21: I have bounced around different photo labs in San Diego and I'm so lucky to have found Fromex Photo. I am super picky on the quality of my printing and this lab
has really made my work look exceptional. They have always been very accommodating on any of my special request in customizing my work.They offer a variety of different products including canvas gallery wraps,metal prints and press printed cards.  Ron, Maria and all the Fromex staff have been very pleasant to work with and I look forward to many more years with with them.

Review 22: i want to start off this review about the women who works the front desk....my god she was helpful and funny.. she knew what she was talking about and was just great to talk and deal with...i am an amateur photographer and was afraid to take my pictures in for touch up but it was refreshing to have someone bright and happy to help me out.. 

the one downside to this place was the pricing....film processing was way more then any other place in town....$6.50 to scan a negative? are u kidding me?...thats outrageous even if it includes the cd with the photos on them....who ever the owner is needs to learn better pricing techniques and lower them...this is a good photolab dont get me wrong but some of the prices are way way out there....so again to the owner.....loosen up!

Review 23: My first experience with fromex was great so I thought I would return to them with more business... Sadly today when I went in the girl was not in a good mood.  She was very unhelpful and when I wasn't sure of what size I wanted my panoramic picture to me she sighed and mad me feel like an idiot.  I asked if she could show me what sizes there were and she made it seem like I was a bother.  I told her I would go somewhere else since it seemed like I was bothering her and she never apologized.  I will never print pictures or go into fromex ever again.  Bummed that their service was so rude and unhelpful.
1

Review 24: Excellent! Took our digital photo files in to have large movie-type posters made for our wedding. Ron resized and manipulated them right before our eyes to get them just right. Came in later to pick up, and they were perfect! Very reasonable cost as well. GREAT overall experience.
5

Review 25: Don't let their small storefront fool you- this is the top-notch professional photo lab in San Diego. I've been using this particular Fromex for years.  I'm a pro photographer and they're work is among the best in San Diego, or nationally.  They can process your RAW image captures, or simply make great prints or scans.  They have the whole range of products from gallery canvas wraps to standout prints, metallic paper, albums or photo banners.  They can mount your photos onto a thin board or onto foam core as well.  The whole team at Fromex is great. Competitive prices and great custom work.  They'll do your passport photos too.
5

Review 26: I am a professional photographer and I get quite a few of my prints done here when I need a quick, local turnaround.  They do a fantastic job with the color balance and they are priced very fairly for the high-quality they offer.   The ordering is pretty easy with their online interface.   I recommend them to my photo clients when they want to get their personal photos done.
5

Review 27: I had some color 120 film processed and printed here and they did a beautiful job on my prints! Not sure if they scan negatives for extra cost, but they're a great place to get your film done!
4

Review 28: I'm a photographer and always need good quality prints.  My friend took me to Fromex and I'm in love!  Maria is the best ever!  She will tweek your prints if need be and get you going.  She's has tons of knowledge and patience.  I highly recommend Fromex for your prints!!!
5

Review 29: Went here to get a shuttle pass for my apartment.  The lady wasn't mean but wasn't very pleasant.  The picture turned out really nice and it only cost me $7.  I saw other pictures people had ordered for weddings and other events and man that was some nice quality work.

Review for Safelight Labs:
Review 1: This place is great. You can (during normal times at least) process all of your own stuff for a pretty low price. They offer classes on photography, printing, and processing I think. There is also a fully equipped studio with low rates, so newbies can practice studio photography without losing their life savings. Great place.
5

Review 2: Professional staff and amazing work with a quick, efficient turn around for film development.

Safelight Labs is a locally owned business run by native Californians established on the outskirts of downtown San Diego. During these pressing times, Safelight have adjusted themselves to a specific drop-off/to-go process in order to successfully stay busy while maintaining the best COVID-19 precautions to ensure safety of their staff as well as their clients. 

I visited Safelight Labs for an inquiry in pricing and left an extremely satisfied customer. Parking is right in front of the door at convenient metered spots (being downtown) and walking up the owner, Caitie, had set up a very safe "limit marker" to allow separation and proper distancing for COVID safety. This method was great for still interacting and asking questions. As a failsafe, they've even taken the opportunity to have a drop-off slot for film development afterwards, using their online processing system on their site to track the orders.

Looking inside, the show room is extremely open and clean with a professional demeanor and tidy look. I saw well placed hand sanitizer and cleaning products over which looked well used. The pricing itself was fair and total turn around being rather quick, within a week.

Speaking to the staff was great, again as an amateur, Caitie the owner was extremely knowledgeable and answered all of my questions respectfully with honesty. It was an absolute pleasure and I plan on frequenting this store again for any future film processing.

Would highly recommend!

Review 3: He did a great job developing my disposable's film. He had is done in less than a day. His dogs are a wonderful touch and you can tell he really cares about his work!
5

Review 4: This place is amazing. I love the concept of a community photo lab and if you ever wanted to own your own dark room but didn't have the space for it this place is that. You can go in and do your thing or sign up for a refresher class.
5

Review 5: I have to say I love this place. The owner is extremely non pretentious and helpful if you have questions and aren't an expert. In any world of niche hobbies, that's rare. Stop by and pick Rob's brain about any topic. He'll speak freely and encourage you to pursue what stimulates you while helping you figure out the intricacies of an art. You can develop and print on your own or he can do it for you for a fair price. He offers classes on photography and development and if you buy your film here, it's always straight from the fridge.
5

Review 6: Welcome to the center of the San Diego film community.  Rob puts his heart and soul into this place and it shows.  Whether it's developing your film, printing in the darkroom, or just picking up some film... safelight is such a wonderful space.  I'm so happy to  have it exist.
5

Review 7: Great place to get back in to developing your own film. They are wonderful to work with.  Making b/w developing film easy to do. Check it out.
5

Review 8: Small business in downtown, owner super friendly. Developed my roll same day and price wasn't bad at all. Definitely coming back.
5

Review 9: This is such a great addition to the San Diego business community. The owner is very engaged and knowledgeable. I love that I am able to find rare film that is hard to find at other places. I also love the fact that I can not only learn at one of the workshops but also use the skills I learned to put them to immediate use by developing my own film on site. Their pricing is great and their business hours are convenient. I definitely recommend that you check them out!

Review for North Coast Photo:
Review 1: I needed a jpg file turned into a mounted photo. This was a very low-res file, but North Coast Photo did a great job of making it look beautiful and mounting it on gatorboard. She showed me what the different options would look like, and I'm so happy with the final product we decided on. Very reasonably priced, especially for all the time they spent with me getting it "just right".
5

Review 2: Wow. 
One day turn around for developing 4 films. 
I am amazed. 

Very professional.

Thanks guys!
5

Review 3: I needed a roll of film developed. They did a wonderful job and got it done quickly! The photos were emailed to me and i was able to pick up my negatives the next day.
5

Review 4: Best prints I've ever gotten back!  I won't be bringing my film anywhere else.  Very happy to have such a great service locally!  People from all over the world send their film here, and for good reason.
5

Review 5: North Coast Photo really bailed me out of a jam. I went to another spot that I'd honestly give 1-star if I felt like being mean as mean as that place was to me. North Coast Photo welcomed me with open arms and sat with me as we worked on getting my photos just right. 

North Coast Photo does it right. They earned my business and they deserve  a shot at yours. Get those beautiful photos off your phone and on your wall.
5

Review 6: High quality work, high attention to detail.   I won't take my photos anywhere else.  They will remove photos from their servers if you want privacy, and deal with more risqué content in a solid professional manner.   Don't waste a minute going anywhere else.  Fast turn around.

Review 7: I was visiting the area and needed to get an old photo touched up and copies made ASAP. Bonnie was so helpful! Job was done beautifully and ready ahead of schedule!
5

Review 8: Bonnie and the gang are rock stars.

Always knowledgeable, always super polite and helpful. 

I've done business here for nearly 20 years. Nothing but the very best. 

Like I said- rock stars. No scatology......
5

Review 9: Long time customer here. NCPS always deliver the best film develop service. Recommend to add cut service to the film so that you can scan yourself easily.
5

Review 10: I've ordered quite a few pictures from them, and they are always high quality prints. I love that when you order prints, you get email updates with the status of your order. The prints arrive in a timely manner, and are always sent in cardboard envelopes with cardboard inserts to protect the prints. 

I will definitely be ordering more prints in the near future
5

Review 11: Professional service, high quality and very customer oriented.  Great for the professional and amateur photographer.
5

Review 12: I have been a customer for years !  It is about time a give them a great review.   North Coast Photo is wonderful, friendly and professional.  Most recently I had my wedding photos developed here.  The prints were all high quality,  crisp, clear, and colors were on point !  I would recommend NCPS !!
5

Review 13: NCPS is the best film processing lab I've had the pleasure of working with. I have mailed my 35mm and 120 format film (B&amp;W, Chrome and negatives) to them from Washington D.C. for nearly a decade, and have never been dissatisfied with the results I receive back. Their customer service is always stellar (shout out to Bonnie), and the quality of their processing is professional grade. It's clear that they put thought and a high level of expertise into their lab work. Despite living on the opposite coast from their lab, I usually receive my processed film and scan disks back within a week. If you're a professional photographer shooting film, or simply someone who wants to see your analog imagery processed correctly and expediently, look no further than NCPS.
5

Review 14: I believe this place deserves a one star since they took advantage of my money and time. I ordered printed and digital photos but the machine was broken at the time so they promised to have them printed when i went to pick up my order. When I came to pick them up after 3 days they only had my digital photos on a cd and was charged for $38. If you want to pay that much for a scan or cd go for it, i recommend Nelson Photo down in point loma. They only require a couple of hours out of your day to have your photos processed. I will never be doing business with North Coast again.
1

Review 15: It has been 9 months since my original review of North Coast, and I am just updating to say that these guys are my favorite place to send film to in the San Diego area.  Why, the quality of the photos they give back to me are the best I have been able to get anywhere.  They do things quickly.  They have not fouled up any of my orders at all.  I do wish they were slightly closer so I could drop off and pick up personally, but maybe I will just plan my day to go up there at non-rush hour.  

My one quibble.  It took me a while to get the postage right when sending in films.  The post office does by different rules besides weight when sending in film.  You need to send it as a package.  So keep that in mind if you mail stuff to North Coast.  

My experience with these guys this year has been five star +.
5

Review 16: I mail my film from NYC and have never been disappointed with the results- in fact always amazed and happy! The customer service couldn't be more pleasant. I had trouble with their download portal the first couple of times and every time I called they were happy to help. The turn around time is amazing. My images are ready to download the day or the day after they are delivered. Highly suggest North Coast Photo :)
5

Review 17: I've used them twice: once to make a large-ish digital print, and once to develop and scan film. Both times they exceeded expectations. I'd recommend them for two particular reasons:
1. Their developing and scanning is about as reasonably priced as you can get in Southern CA. There might be lower prices online, but I like to keep my business local.
2. Their customer service is very responsive and proactive. The film I sent in had poor quality control, and as soon as they received it they let me know that there had been issues in the past, which helped me avoid any nasty surprises.
5

Review 18: Staff is friendly and communicative. I get my medium format film processed and scanned here as well as prints. They can turn over pretty quickly, too. As I'm not in San Diego anymore, they can handle all my material over phone/email pretty well. A nice place to get your high quality material handled by pros. This is a mom-and-pop endeavor done in a very professional way.
5

Review 19: I brought in a precious letter written by my mother that was old and fading. I wanted to preserve it and give a copy to each of my 11 siblings. Phyllis was so helpful and gave excellent customer service. The finished product was terrific and done for a very fair price! I would recommend the folks at North Coast Photo for any photo/printing restoration and preservation!
5

Review 20: I have never worked with slide film before, so wanted to send the film to a well known trusted source for developing.  The film arrived on a Wednesday and I had my Enhanced Resolution scans downloaded via their FTP server by 11:30 AM the next morning.  

Highly Recommended!  Thanks to Bonnie and the team for all the help!

Review 21: I cannot say enough good things about the folks at NCPS.  The turnaround time is amazing; they know what they're doing.  I won't send my film anywhere else.

One time when I picked up an order, I was invited into the back for a tour by one of the owners.  It was obvious they are passionate about their work and take pride in what they send back to customers.
5

Review 22: These guys are just the best. I've only recently started dealing with them, but I've already seen for myself that their quality is top notch, their turnaround time is amazing, and their prices are exceptional. I live in Northern California and have to mail them my film for processing, but my local lab sends out 120 roll film themselves, so it takes just as long if I drop it off there -- but ncps is way less expensive, and the quality of their processing and scanning is much better. So now I'm having them do a custom print job for me, and Bonnie has gone way out of her way to make sure I'm getting what I want and when I need it by. I'm just blown away by them.
5

Review 23: I sent negatives to North Coast that a local pro processing/camera shop told me could only be done well in giclee. Bonnie worked so hard and the results show it! She stayed in contact with me when she realized there were a few problems and in the end I got much better results than I got from the other source. I won't hesitate to use them again, and from what I've read it sounds like Bonnie isn't alone in her determination to get the best results! But thank you Bonnie for working so hard for me!
5

Review 24: great professional film services in San Diego for reasonable prices. friendly and fast too and just all around a good experience. when I picked up my negatives they even offered me their light box and scope to have a look at the frames before i left. will definitely recommend to all my friends who still shoot film.
5

Review 25: If I could give this place 7 stars, I would. It's that good. Yes, it isn't "bargain bin" cheap, but you can't get quality like this elsewhere. I'm an amateur photographer at best and this place makes my shots look like a million bucks. The quality of the scans are top notch and the customer service is as good as it gets. Just today, they stayed open for an extra few minutes so I could hand my film over to em. I can tell you right now no other spot would do that. As I said to the lady who helped me, I won't take my film anywhere else. 

Bottom line, if you want quality you have to pay for it, but with that price comes customer service that is unparalleled. There's handfuls of places that can provide the service they do, but not at their level. I'm moving halfway across the country in a few months and I'll be sticking with NCPS for as long as I'm shooting film. Thanks NCPS!
5

Review 26: I have been getting my film developed here for years. They hold themselves to highest of standards. As a working photographer I need high quality with fast turnaround and north coast has always delivered.
5

Review 27: I was super happy with the scans of my 35mm film, also known as "Rockwell Scans." They really were beautiful. They even knew that a shot done at night shouldn't be over-corrected to look grey. Turn around time was very quick, and the fees were very reasonable, not much more than the cost to develop a roll at Walgreens, but with pro results! Will be a repeat customer!

Review 28: 4x5 SHOOTERS:
Lemme start off by saying, I'm a busy douchey L.A. photographer who asks, NO...scratch that... DEMANDS nothing but the best. "Excellence" is a a two letter word "M-E."

Meanwhile, the truth is I scan in my sweat stained underwear, shirtless. Flatbed scan no less. BUT...mofo, I still shoot film. Not only shoot film, I shoot the largest format my scant bank account can afford: 4x5. So I read a few reviews here and decided to give them a try. Since I'm in merry ol' small town of Los Angeles, I had to mail this to them. So I got me a model and took some images of her.

Funny that Nikkor 210mm-W doesn't have a binocular adapter. I mean...my sexy next door neighbor's window aside, I packaged them up with a self-addressed stamp envelope. Young folk won't remember that this is how we use to get our amazing growing dinosaurs back from our UPC symbols.

Four days later, packed, wrapped and back into my box. Three 4x5 slides. $9.50 (this is tax included since I live in Kah-li-fo-nia).

Atop of the mailers, stamps/return stamp and other misc. packaging, it was $13.25 all together. A fine deal. My usual lab here in L.A. would've been $14. But, no matter, the convenience of dropping off into mailbox and having it come to your house is worth the 75 cents. It will make more cents (get it) when I shoot a LOT more. S/H was the difference maker. I filled out my paperwork in detail. What bugs me about creative types (sometimes) is how often this is overlooked. To me, this detail reflects how some people who don't know your stupid face will treat you and your neg.

Anyways, HIGHLY recommend this place. Class act all the way. In fact, they had a real classy sticker on an envelope with my negatives. I kept wondering if they didn't accidentally send me someone else's, 'cause it was museum-like classy. Nope. Mine.

Love that they accommodated my workflow.

Wonderful find. And thanks to Yelp reviewers for the recommendation.

Review 29: I love this place! Great turnaround, very fair pricing and great people. I used to use some pro labs in LA, but it is so much easier to use North Coast Photographic for my  120 film developing/scanning/printing. Their quality has always been top notch, for color or B&amp;W. I had them do some retouching on a portrait and they did a great job at very reasonable cost as well. If I could give them six stars I would.
5

Review 30: Only problem are the lack of hours on weekends....since thesis part time I usually do photo stuff Saturdays when they are not open or have to spend lunch in their shop
4

Review 31: These guys are great.  I live in NorCal and FedX my film batches down to them.  Yep I bypass all the SF labs for these guys.  The turnaround is quick and the results are excellent and consistent.  Their service is always friendly and cheerful too!
5

Review 32: I hate my commute for work but I found the one thing to love about it and that is this place! I just pulled out my medium format camera after 16 years so I wanted to see if this 16 year old film would still make images. I drop the film off when I get off the freeway then go pick it up on my lunch hour at 2pm. They are busy! They got film coming in from all over the country. It is so nice to find someone who still develops 120 film and it starts at 5.75 a roll for developing. You can't beat that. I do have to give them only 4 stars because I've only sent two rolls of 16 year old film so I haven't had any really big jobs go through there. Nice staff and I like the way the owner says he's not giving up on film. I can't say anything about the fact they are only open through the week because I live in SD and commute to Carlsbad for work so I wouldn't be driving up there on my off day. I guess it would help those in the area if they were open on Satursday at least but then again, the employees are probably photographers and they want to get out and shoot also.
4

Review 33: Pricewise for film scanning and developing, this place seriously cannot be beat. 

I shoot a lot of 120mm and it costs an arm and a leg at some places to develop it. I was charged $31 at one place for ONE roll. WHAT?! I can get three rolls developed and scanned (budget really, don't need high quality because the budget is excellent anyway) for a good price. Developing starts around $5-6. 

Really quick turnaround time as well. I send off my film and get it within the week. My most recent package though didn't get sent until two weeks later and that was because there was confusion on whether I was going to pick it up or not in store. No worries because they packaged my film and sent it to me asap. Got to me the next day! I actually got an email confirmation less than five minutes after my phone call to them saying my package has been sent. Score. 

Now I would of picked it up in store but there is a problem... and the reason this place isn't five stars. They're open only Mon-Fri 9-5pm.... I work a full-time job Mon-Fri 9-5pm. Now if they were open on saturdays (even only for a few hours!!) my rating would automatically jump up to five. 

soooo sooo close to being perfect!
4

Review 34: Needed a print and anything I could find online wouldn't work for that particular item or if it did the cost was stupid. Tried Walmart etc Instore and they look like their head will explode unless you hand them a memory card of some standard sized snaps. Need a specialist place.
These guys would print my photo any size I wanted and the price was realistic. I also had the confidence of explaining exactly what I wanted and getting it too, without any hassle.
Glad I found this place.
5

Review 35: I've only had film developed and scanned here. I haven't tried giving them any of my print business to date, but my assessment so far is that North Coast Photo is a well run business. Pricing is competitive for film scanning, and the quality is very good, if not excellent. Customer service is excellent. They run a clean, productive shop, and everyone that works there seems professional and happy (very good signs of a well managed, healthy business). Turn around time is reasonable. I have nothing but good things to say about NCPS. I just wish they were closer to where I live (UTC/La Jolla area). To me it's worth the drive, or worth shipping cost + shipping time.
5

Review 36: Based on the Ken Rockwell reference, I send North Coast all my 120 for processing and scanning.   The turnaround is reasonably quick but most importantly the processing and scanning is excellent.  The scans are clean and with the correct contrast range - eg underexposed thin negs show up looking like underexposed thin negs, well-exposed negs scanned with all the detail in highlights and shadows that I see in the neg.  I live near NYC but haven't found anyone here that compares.

Review for Camera Exposure:
Review 1: Camera Exposure has REALLY turned around in the last few months. The staff and owner are extremely friendly and very helpful while keeping a professional attitude and incredibly knowledgeable in-depth of everything technical and commercial in cameras. They KNOW their stuff.

When I first walked into camera exposure Rob (the owner) greeted me with a friendly and enthusiastic welcome. Using their well-placed hand sanitizer around the store front and reading their clearly labeled COVID-19 pandemic precaution signs, it shows that he and his staff care a lot about my safety as well as the safety of their own during these trying times.

The store itself is well-lit and displays a rather diverse and expansive showcase on camera bodies, types, and accessories. There were TONS of lenses on display catering to the novice and seasoned photographer along with a variety of larger items to include studio set-ups, flash lenses, mounts, tripods, and more! I feel like Rob and his team stacked everything on hand which gave me a ton of time to explore and shop around. Not to forget to mention that all the equipment was clean and orderly. It was a gear-junkie's dream. Everything was reasonably priced too, following market value or below on their sales.

The staff was polite, Rob even on stand by while working to answer a variety of questions. Everyone seemed very attentive for an easy and seamless check out which left me wanting to go back.

I would HIGHLY recommend a visit to Camera Exposure for purchase, questions, or repair relating to all your photography needs! I know I'll be returning.
5

Review 2: I'm so so so happy that I stopped into Camera Exposure to buy a tripod for my up and coming road trip. I ended up leaving with a beautiful black Canon A1 which I was buying as a surprise for the person I was at the store with. The staff was so helpful at keeping the purchase lowkey. I told them about my road trip and they gave me amazing spots to visit on the way and in the parks for photos. I wish I got the guys name who was working there because genuinely such a great guy! Gave great recommendations and options. Also have used equipment in great condition which makes it great price. Wish this place shipped down to Miami.
5

Review 3: I call this place to fix my camera and the man that I speak with was very rude. He act like I am inferior to he and treat me with very rude and 'smart-pant' comment. After this call, I decide to buy new camera from different store. I will NOT recommend this business. Go place else!
1

Review 4: I'm so happy with the speedy service now I can get back to filming videos. My camera has been broken for months and I finally decided to find a place to fix it. I'm so glad I brought my camera here I'm very big on customer service and I'm pleased with my outcome. Thank you again...
5

Review 5: Awful customer service, asked for help with a camera and gave me nothing but dismissive remarks and ironic comments. Originally had my camera fixed here but it broke quickly afterwords and they did not take responsibility. I would head towards a more reputable source!

Review 6: This film camera shop is one of the few hidden gems in San Diego. If you're still looking for your grandparents old film camera and can't find it, chances are you may find it at this shop!
5

Review 7: I would like to start with the positive aspect of this shop. Very unique, no other camera stores stock as much vintage cameras and lenses as this place. I have been coming here for about ten years now and it's always been bitter sweet. Great gear but TERRIBLE costumer service, I have spent so much money here and I always have some bullshit I have to put up with when I come in. One time I purchased a enlarger for printing 4x5 color negatives, first he asked us why we were even printing color and that it's a waste of time. (NOT A GOOD BUSINESS TACTIC KEN) we didn't test it in the shop because they said everything works. We took it home, the bulb was very dim and we couldn't print, we drove all the way back down from Oceanside to get a replacement bulb and they made a huge deal trying to make US pay for the new bulb. The enlarger was close to 300$ and they were sour about giving us a $3 bulb. I bought a used Patterson 5 reel tank that he said was in perfect condition, even though it looked pretty banged up. There was an old piece of gaff tape on the side that I didn't think to check out and when I went to develop my first batch it happened it be that there was a huge crack under the tape. I didn't even bother calling them and telling them because they would've just had some smart ass thing to say, so I ended up just repairing it myself since I spent so much money on it. They are also very condescending and pretentious when talking to costumers, this last weekend I was in the shop looking around for a lens for my girlfriends new camera, I also wanted to look at two different cameras while shopping. Ken condescendingly asked me before letting me see the first one if I could afford it. And the second camera was one that I have had my eye on for years and finally saw one in person. He again asked me if I could afford it laughingly and I said no not right now but I would love to own one one day. He said no and would not let me check it out. I said are you serious? I'm a regular customer and Im not going to drop it or whatever and he said I know you don't have the money so if it where to fall and break he wouldn't want to be out of the money. I understand where he is coming from. He doesn't want everyone coming in and asking to see everything but it's literally EVERY time I'm there he has to say some smart ass remark. Putting me down is so disrespectful for a store owner to do. I have put off leaving a yelp review for years because I support the cause of a used camera shop. But this last incident really pissed me off.  This shop is One of the last of its kind, and unfortunately with the way things are ran here, I don't see the longevity of it lasting.

Review 8: I really don't understand the negative reviews. I stopped in on a busy day and the owner was very helpful. I picked up a Nikon f2 for an extremely reasonable price. Most other shops would have been double. Once I got home, I found the iso dial wasn't working. I took it back and he swapped out the part in a few minutes. Definitely worth a visit as he has a huge selection of used

Review 9: Terrible customer service here. I came in trying to buy a wide angle lens but the owner was very condescending. He tried to sell me zoom lenses every though I was specifically looking for a prime wide angle lens. He also was saying that DX lenses do not crop even though they clearly do, claiming that the 35mm on a crop body is true 35mm. Ridiculous, does not know his stuff and an absolutely horrendous attitudetowards customers.

Review 10: This place was so bad that I actually had to make a Yelp account just to tell y'all a little something about this place. 

Don't even waste your time at all coming to this place because the owner is a pretentious, egotistical, and mildly racist middle-aged white guy. I was referred to go this place by a friend, so of course I was super excited to go check it out. Right when I got there the owner started giving me some super weird vibes lol. 

I was telling him how much I missed stores like this because I barely seem them around anymore and he started to brag about how his store is the best and how it's better than all these "other" stores??? Yeah it was pretty strange.

Then, I started to ask him about film cameras and he started talking to me in a very condescending way lol. I was asking him simple questions and he was replying extremely rude and basically like a smart ass. 

Anyways, he thought I was just another kid who didn't know my sh*t but I sold him my medium format camera for twice as much as I bought it sooooo thanks Ken for doubting me (: you were able to help me sell my gear fast. 

TL;DR dont go here because the owner is an impatient, egotistic, pretentious, stuck-up a**hole it's not worth your time or the drive.

Review 11: LOVE LOVE the rental department. Spend lotsa cash there. BUT went to return something I purchased today from the store side and they charged me a 15% 'restocking fee.' When I asked if that could be waived because it seemed like a lot he explained it was for the credit card processing fees, not just returning the item to the shelf. I get it. but 15%? They took $50 off my refund for something I never used. I'm just really surprised that a policy like this is in place considering they're competing with Amazon and other online retailers who don't do this. I won't ever shop for goods there again.

Review 12: I had a terrible customer service experience here. It takes a lot for me to write a bad review, but I felt highly offended about the way I was treated.

I am a beginning photographer and came in looking for gear to outfit with my strobe lights. I asked Ken if there was a possibility of renting the equipment he recommended and he laughed off my question like he thought I was an idiot for even asking. Further into our conversation he referred to me as "are these the star photographers who are working these days?" COMPLETELY inappropriate and rude! I responded with saying, I'm just starting out...and then he started to walk back his comment like it was all ok. He also mimicked my voice in what I'm guessing was an attempt at a women's voice. I am a reasonable person, but when someone acts this way, it's not ok &amp; should be called out. I CANNOT BELIEVE THE WAY I WAS TREATED and will NEVER return. 

If you want to experience rampant sexism, condescending commentary and lack of basic decency in customer service, be my guest. If not, don't give this place your business. 

I went straight over to George's Camera after, just blocks away, and had a WONDERFUL customer experience. They respectfully &amp; kindly provide information and ensure that you are getting fair prices. I highly recommend George's Camera for whatever you need.

Review 13: I've been using this shop for around 10 years.  I have NEVER had a bad customer service experience, so I don't know what's up with some of the reviews.  Yeah, they're a small shop, and they take time with their customers, so if there are people in front of you, there might be a wait.  It's miles ahead of the big retailers, and Ken used to work for Nikon, so he sometimes does repairs locally  that everyone else would send to the company.
I've always felt that Ken is looking out for my best interests.

Review 14: This store has supported me when I was taking a photography class at City College. Each time I come in, Ken is very helpful and knowledgeable and is fair in pricing. This store is a treasure trove of all things photography and I was able to buy everything I needed for my film class and I continue to come in for my personal photography needs.

Review 15: Wonderful store, and extremely helpful. I got a free lesson on how to load film, (because I had obviously forgot) and I asked for some rolls of film and got them. No nonsense and will definitely be returning back. PS most of the bad reviews are from people trying to sell their stuff, I would rather just buy from them, that's a delightful experience.

Review 16: I finally got here! Will definitely come back and hopefully the lens that I saw is still there! The owner was so nice and helpful with all my questions. Thank you! Will come back soon!

Review 17: Ken is very knowledgeable and helpful.  We sold some vintage cameras that we found at a relative's house.  He is fair in his pricing as he also has to turn around and make a profit.  (I do believe you *could* get higher prices selling on eBay or OfferUp; but, you have to find the right buyer, have patience, pay for shipping at times, etc, etc, all requiring more effort that I felt like putting forth)  I feel that his used equipment was priced fairly, if not a bit low!  I did purchase a used camera there.  I would definitely do business with Camera Exposure again.  It is refreshing to find someone that is equally interested in saving old gear from going to a landfill.  :-)

Review 18: I've been in here several times and each experience is the same, shitty. The employees are extremely rude and condescending to customers. Don't try to sell your gear here just do it yourself online. They offer less than half of what the product is worth. The only saving grace this place has for me is that they sell my favorite film stock but I will be purchasing it from Amazon from this point on. I'm honestly confusion by all the good reviews. Take your film to Nelson's Photo they do color film in house so you usually get it back same day and it's much cheaper, or mail up it to The Dark Room Lab in San Clemente either option is better than this place.

Review 19: Came in with my grandpa's old camera and asked if they'd took a look at it. They very patiently checked it out and gave me a little crash course on its operation and maintenance. Really appreciated this and I'll definitely be heading here for all my photography needs in the future.

Review 20: This store has supported the photography students of City College for many years. I don't relate to the reviews saying customer service is unfriendly. I've always had great service here. Today I went in for the first time in about 14 years and it was a pleasure to see Ken still running the business. The size of the space has diminished over the years, but the stock seems to have remained the same, so you can imagine it's pretty cramped. It's a real treasure trove of photographic equipment.

Ken was working with another customer, but Mano (sorry if I misremembered his name) just about turned the store upside down looking for a filter that would fit my Leica. I paid just over $25 for a filter that would have cost me $140 new from B&amp;H. 

Ken is very knowledgeable and offers great advice. I'm sure it's as much of a vocation as a business, so maybe he doesn't always grovel to make a buck from customers, but I find it refreshing that a unique store like this still exists in the Internet age.

Review 21: Tons of great gear and cameras in here, everything that I've seen is reasonably priced. One of the only places I've seen in San Diego with enlargers, red lights, chemical trays etc. for personal dark rooms. Solid selection of film, everyone I've talked to is extremely knowledgeable though sometimes there is a bit of a cranky older men vibe from the employees. If you're in the San Diego area and have ANY questions regarding film, cameras (digital or film), tripods, lenses etc. this is the place to go. Skip eBay and shop local, I guarantee you'll pick up way more interesting knowledge as well as great gear.

Review 22: I've never written a bad review. i work in customer service and have for over 10years, i also have been doing photography on the side for 2 years. 

my goodness, there's only one person behind the counter so a wait is fine... but when you're all done ringing up the customer before and there's another 10min wait bc you're talking about the past well, what is that? i started the stopwatch on my phone to really make sure i wasn't exaggerating the wait time and threw my headphones on and listened to some music while i waited to not get irritated. 

after a bit of time i proceed to ask about a lens, the camera is having difficulty focusing and i wanted to purchase a different one so i could use a macro lens- he asked me where i got the lens and i replied online(it was a gift) and hell hath no fury with the pretentious response he gives me ; excuse you right after you berated me about where the lens came from my mind was made to Not support this store. 

How does someone get experience? by learning and this place in no way has dignity towards those who aren't on par with his expectations and that is shameful. 

really cool stuff, the owner is really knowledgeable and would benefit from some non judgmental courses to be inclusive of the changing times. acceptance does wonders.

Review 23: Such a neat shop, I'm sure there's just about all kinds of cameras and accessories you can think of! Ken was very nice, friendly, and helpful! He was kind to inspect my camera to make sure it was in working order. Will be going here for all my photography needs from now on. Fantastic service. Thank you, Ken! :)

Review 24: Still the #1 camera shop in SD! Definitely stop by here first for all your camera needs. They know their stuff and have great gear.

Review 25: The store owner was very knowledgeable. He was able to fix my camera in little to no time. He also recommended another product that was cheaper and better than the one I currently had. Great prices on both used and new products. Again, incredibly well versed and outstanding gentlemen. He is not out to swindle you or steal your money. I highly recommend this place.

Review 26: Kens the best. No non sense straight shooter. Prices are more then fare, on all his used equipment. He continues to amaze me with his knowledge and advice.

Review 27: Very reliable business,  The owner will go out of his way to make a business transaction go Regina ment as I have known him for a long time and has on several businesses all in a successful way and ending And currently is doing very well with this one
5

Review 28: Although the owner may come across as "mean" or "rude", he is very knowledgeable and straight to the point. I had a positive experience and purchased my first film camera. The selection is diverse and far better than what you'll find in stores, at least around the San Diego area. Don't let the strong personality steer you away. Come in knowing what you're looking for and stick to it.

Review 29: This store is great. The owner is really knowledgeable, they have a huge selection of great camera gear and you can get wonderful film here. If you're in the area go here!

Review 30: Having just moved to San Diego a few months ago, I was looking for a camera store that I could regularly purchase film from and, if I ever needed to, to buy a camera from. I have recently been looking for 35mm point and shoot cameras so I called ahead of time to see what variety of point snd shoot cameras were avaliable and I was told that I needed to "hurry up with my question" because he was working with a customer and it really put me off but I swept it under the rug because I assumed that maybe it was a miserable employee working that day. So I decided to take a little trip over to this store and apparently this, what I thought, was a "miserable employee" was actually the owner! I walked into the store and asked what point and shoots he had, and was at first dismissed for a solid 15 minutes while he chatted with another customer. After about 15 minutes, he pointed the cameras out and started off by asked why I would ever want one and then proceeded to belittle me for my lack of knowledge of an obscure camera brand. [I want to preface what I'm about to say by stating that I am 18 and fairly inexperienced with film but it is something I very much enjoy] He then proceeded to lecture me as to why "millennials" are ruining film because they are only interested in purchasing the same 5 cameras. He then continued to be extremely condescending and quite honestly, at this point, I don't care if they have the most amazing cameras in San Diego, you could not pay me to spend a dime here.

Review 31: I don't remember the name of the person helping me but he was really really helpful. One of my lens covers was broken and he managed to fix it at no charge, the selection of lenses are never ending here. I found the exact lens I was looking for a reasonable price. Prior to coming here I had my camera fixed somewhere else. The guy helping me here told me that he could have fixed it a lot cheaper than the other store I had went to. If only I had known this sooner. Definitely Going to bring my business here from now on.

Review 32: This is a classic used camera shop that has a big collection of all the major brands and some exotic smaller makers.  There are lots of both film and digital cameras here.  They also develop both color and black and white film.  They can give you scans that the person that helped me said were about 3,000 pixels in one direction.  Develop and scan runs about 13 bucks.  They do prints too.  The person in this shop was helping me and a couple of other people and was very friendly and, well, helpful.  

I did end up buying a lens for one of my older cameras that I had been thinking about buying for a long time.  It was just a bit over the average ebay or on line price, but the one I got at Camera Exposure looked like it was new.  So mint condition.  Plus it came with a 90 day guarantee.

Update 12-5-17. I have upped my rating from 4 to 5 stars.  I am very happy with the vintage Olympus lens I bought here a couple of months ago.  It looked like new and also works like new.  But I also had my first two rolls of film developed here.  They did a great job.  The film was done in one working day and the scans were great.  The scans came out just over 3000 x 2000 so the files are just over 6 mega pixels.  That may not seem like much today when an iPhone can give you shots that are 4032 x 3024 but on a high quality 27" computer monitor the scans look excellent and are the standard ones.  You can get finer scans for an up charge.

Review 33: Excellent experience with a minor repair. This is the sort of local shop and owner I'll be happy to give more business to.

Review 34: Yelp really needs a "doesn't even rank" option.

The first time i went, i was corrected on my terminology, "educated" on my understanding of crop v full-frame lenses (and by that I mean that was told that since I owned a crop, I should already understand how it works) and corrected when I mis-stated the range of a lens I had at home.  I left considering a purchase even though I felt I had been slammed into a wrestling mat just to get the information that I needed.

The second time I went, I was again corrected when I mis-stated the range of a lens I had at home, told by whomever it was that he had "25 years experience, so he should know" and made to feel like I had committed a cardinal sin for naming the wrong lens range.  Bottom line, that lens didn't matter!  I knew what I was looking to purchase and didn't even get a chance to state that as I was so put off by the approach of the guy, not once, but twice, that I will never return.  

I urge you not to go if you aren't 100% sure of your EXACT lens names and ranges, oh, and unless you have complete knowledge and expertise in every photography method, technology, and term out there!  Every "expert" needs to remember they started knowing nothing as well.  If you just want to sell and not deal with questions or "inferiors", have an online only store...otherwise, learn some customer service.

I HIGHLY recommend George's Camera.  They "educate" in a respectful way, because they want potential customers to learn the craft, understand the technology, and return.

Review 35: Though I am giving it a 1 star, there are some positives to the store. 

Here are some positives: fast way to sell gear and get money quick. Lots of variety when shopping. Knowledgeable, yet extremely rude store owner. So basically the only positives are that you can get (lowball) money for gear you want to sell instead of the Craigslist route, and you can buy nice gear relatively cheaper than in other stores but more expensive than Craigslist prices. 

Here is why this store deserves a 1 star:
First off you will receive the worst customer service in your life. The owner, Ken, is a complete jerk who has some superiority complex. He MUST one up you, correct you on things that are meaningless, and belittle you while negotiating, the list goes on. Complete jerk and I'm only using that word because yelp will remove other words. I don't write bad reviews but I seriously leave that shop beyond pissed off and angered every time so I must squander this Ken guy somehow. 
Second, they lowball the crud out of you. But thats to be expected since it is a store. When negotiating he will give you complete BS reasons as to why he won't offer more. 

Ken literally told me I have no clue how the business world works because I asked for a higher price on the lens I was trying to sell him, screw off peasant. I am allowed to negotiate just like you're allowed to be an imbecile, but apparently he could care less about his business' goodwill as long as he feels superior to people paying him THOUSANDS of dollars. 

Ha, that reminds me of the time he mislead me into a deal that cost me a few hundred dollars. Sure, it was my fault, I guess. But he told me he had a brand new lens for sale (which it was). He told me it was %10 off. Well yea, 10% of the bs price he came up with and after that %10 off the lens was still more than it was on Amazon. My fault for not checking Amazon first, but I assumed I could trust this buckwheat. But no, he is an arrogant, non ethic having POS. 

have a great day!

Review 36: I would like to start by saying, if there was an option for less than one star I would give it... So I set out to buy a lens the other day and I knew I was going to buy one no matter what because of the pictures I was planning on taking. I walked into this shop with my friend and I saw an older man behind the counter talking to the only other customer in the shop, he looked at both of us but said nothing and continued to talk to the other customer. So my friend and I patiently waited to be helped since I did have some questions about the type of lens I was planning on purchasing, but after about ten minutes of not being acknowledged I was getting irritated especially since he wasn't even talking to the customer about his purchase, at this point they were just chatting about random crap. So he starts making his way towards us and I'm thinking finally I can get my lens and go, but instead he walks directly next to us to talk to the customer about another product next to where we are standing and still doesn't acknowledge us at all. 
So after waiting probably another five minutes to see if he would say, "I'll be with you in just a moment" or something like that we finally left. As we are walking out thats when he finally says, "can I help you?" that sounded more irritated than actually wanting to help us. The customer he was talking to even screams out, "Oh I'm done with him" while the old guy behind the counter follows us out as if he would somehow pursued us to come back in. Well a quick Yelp search and a Lyft later we found ourselves at George's Camera where we were greeted by multiple people right away and were out of the store in under five minutes with my brand new lens. The staff there was superior in every way and I'm glad I gave my business to them rather than a grumpy old man who doesn't know what customer service is. Oh and if he is reading this, I would like him to know he missed out on a $600 dollar sale that would have taken him just a few minutes.

Review 37: This guy is very knowledgeable but he is an outright crook. I am a beginner and I bought a few things from him and later found out that I paid double then the price of internet.. YES DOUBLE!!!!!  I work alot and finally got back over to see him and asked if he would buy the items back. Of course he would have nothing to do with that and made up a bunch of excuses.. Don't buy anything from him unless you have done your research. Horrible feeling to find out you have been totally ripped off.

Review 38: Do NOT shop here if you are looking for or expecting any type of friendliness, customer service, or sincerity. Do NOT shop here especially if you are a novice/ beginner (you will be constantly interrupted, insulted, and corrected), or are looking for a friendly place that you can go to for your questions. 

I have written less than 5 bad reviews in my entire life, but I couldn't be more disappointed and truly let down in my experience today. I admittedly know very little about cameras but was really excited to find a store that said they had a large selection of the Kodak Brownie cameras on hand, so I made the hour long drive to the store to try and find the perfect camera for my girlfriend as an emotional and sentimental gift. Her recently deceased grandmother used to have one and they'd take pictures with it when she was younger. Her descriptions were vague but I knew she wanted a Brownie Box Camera that literally looked like a plain box and she said you looked into a hole and hit the button. 

When I got there, the salesman was nice (though he had a sense of humor that took a few seconds to get used to- but once you do, you'll realize that he is pretty friendly). I was told that while they do have the cameras in stock, they are in the back room and that he did not know which ones the owner was willing to sell so I wouldn't be able to buy any of them until the owner came in after 1. 

I was bummed, but remained hopeful. I asked if I could see a few examples of the cameras they had in order to examine the quality and see what they looked like. That way, I'd have a general idea of what cameras they had so when the owner came in, I could talk to him over the phone and have an idea of which cameras to ask him about in regards to availability and price. He hesitated but then brought out just one camera. I liked the quality enough and it looked like a box, so I asked him to give the owner my phone number and have him call me to talk about the cameras. I hadn't heard anything by like 1:45, so I thought I'd call down and see if there was any news and the owner answered. That is when it got really bad. 

I explained to him the situation and asked if any of the cameras were available. Right off the bat, he spoke down to me in a patronizing tone and kept correcting every simple thing I said, while talking over me every chance he could. Before making the hour drive again, I was trying to get information on which ones he was willing to sell and he just kept telling me to come into the store to look. I explained again I was there earlier but live an hour away so I wanted to make sure that there was a suitable camera for sale before driving back down. He continued to talk down to me and tell me that he has 10 people in the store so he's not going to go into the back room to dig through the cameras for someone on the phone. The most information I could get from him was, "ya we have a few different types of cameras that range in prices." Then he even told me that the one and only camera that the salesman would show me was a box camera but wasn't even a "Brownie" model. 

All I was looking for was at least a willingness to help and offer a little more detail on the box cameras he had or a price range or the condition but Instead, I was lectured on how "Brownie" was a term that was used for many years so my girlfriend didn't know much about what she was asking for. That might be true- probably is true, but I never presented myself as an expert. I went into the situation and store, introducing myself as a novice who wanted to find a nice gift for someone I care about. I figured a professional, who undoubtedly knows his cameras, would be able to offer at least some assistance or information when a potential customer goes in asking for "a Brownie Box Camera that takes the 620 film," even if I wasn't sure of the exact make, model, and manufacture year. 

I read some of his other reviews online, and there are quite a few complaints about people experiencing this same exact type of treatment and behavior when they went into the store, so it's not just a bad day or single customer. The selection admittedly blew me away, but if you're someone who doesn't like or appreciate being talked at, spoken down to, ignored, insulted, and treated like a nuisance who shouldn't be there or asking questions, then I would seriously suggest you take your money and questions elsewhere. I sure did- and that means a lot considering how important finding this gift was for me. I am now taking my chances buying online because there is no way I would ever give my money to or support a business after being treated so poorly by the man who owns it.

Review 39: Brought cameras in hopes they would sell. Most weren't worth much. The guy who owns it is very knowledgeable. I felt the price he gave us for what he wanted was a little low, but I just wanted to get a lot of it off my hands.
3

Review 40: I really liked Ken's no-nonsense and his shop full of gorgeous vintage and newer used gear. I didn't get a huge amount of money for my used camera (much less than eBay) but hey this was a shop and he paid me right away. He had an excellent replacement camera that he exchanged for a decent price as well.

The thing that I appreciated was that the shop and all the visitors just reeked of expertise. I love shops like Ken's.
5

Review 41: Recently broke my Pentax Super ME and went in to find a replacement. Ken knew exactly what camera I was looking for and had it in stock. 

This place is really amazing. I've never seen another store like it. 100% recommend for any of your camera needs. All the cameras are serviced and in working condition, so although it is more expensive than cameras at a thrift store they are guaranteed to work and look pristine. 

I plan on getting all of my film developed here from now on.
5

Review 42: I am addicted to manual lenses, and film shooting. I feel like I'm a kid in a candy store looking at all the possibilities. Ebay is no longer an option for purchases, for me. Great store... I try to stop in once a week or every two weeks
4

Review 43: Even though this place may be a bit more expensive than if you were to buy online, this place is great. I can honestly say I am very happy with my purchases. I came in knowing exactly what I wanted and walked out happy and confident with my purchase. That said, if you are someone new to film photography or you don't really know what you are looking for, this isn't the place for you. I would recommend George's Camera or Nelson's if you want to get into film photography. Camera Exposure is definitely for the seasoned film photographer that knows what they want.

Ken is very attentive and knowledgeable. It can get pretty hectic and overwhelming so I totally understand if he's skipping over me to help someone else. When he dealt with me, he was very helpful and even went to the back to grab a specific part for my camera that I asked for.
4

Review 44: I've changed my mind about this shop.   Not having anywhere else to go and shop a huge selection of used gear locally, I was bored and ventured in here again.   I've even gone back a few more times recently.    Ken is very helpful and will spend time digging through his huge inventory looking for very specific items you may need.   

Every time I'm in here I find a great deal on a nice piece of kit.
4

Review 45: Absolutely love this store.  When it comes to cameras, lens and gear it really is fun to shop at Camera Exposure.  The team is very knowledgable.  Just picked up a really nice gently used Monopod ($40) for my Nikon D3100 and 300mm lens.  It was perfect for stabilizing surfing and concert shots at the Switchfoot BroAM event and ideal for large crowded areas.  These guys are awesome!
5

Review 46: Camera Exposure is a gem. The staff is highly knowledgeable and courteous and the merchandise fantastic. It's my first stop whenever I need anything used - I have bought so much studio equipment from them! And they have always been incredibly generous with their time, advice, and expertise.  We are very lucky in San Diego to have three outstanding camera shops - Nelson's, George's, and Camera Exposure.
5

Review 47: I found myself here on the referral of a clerk at Kurt's Camera, I was looking to price some used prime lenses for an upcoming shoot. Hoping to look around I was interrupted when Ken begrudgingly confronted me. I asked about "used and refurbished lenses" and got lecture on vocabulary and trade terms - which was off-putting. Still looking to find some a decent prime I stayed only to be spoken down to and dismissed the more I described my situation. I get the impression that they aren't extremely concerned about rapport and customer service because they believe their merchandise sells itself, which is probably true they've a great selection. I just couldn't bring myself to buy anything from a place that didn't seem like they wanted my business.
2

Review 48: Amazing experience!  I just bought a vintage Brownie camera, and Ken was very kind and helpful.  I can't wait to practice with my camera and get more comfortable with vintage photography.  Everything I needed was fairly priced.  I know I will be back to this store many times in the future.

Review 49: Went in to spend a grand or so on some used Nikon lenses, but was ignored, so I left and got what I wanted on eBay. So if I were you I would ignore this old place.

Review 50: I'm a full time (digital) photographer, getting back into film for the first time in 12 years. In my 12 year career I've been to a lot of camera stores and had a variety of repairs, so I'll preface my review by saying 'this ain't my first rodeo' with a camera shop. 

Here was my experience with this store. I had an issue with the aperture sticking on my old film camera, so I dropped it off here for repair on December 9th. The older man who helped me confirmed that the aperture control arm was broken, but that he could see if he could get a part for the camera. So I paid a $35 diagnosis fee, for what I'm not sure because he had already diagnosed it with me standing there. Ok fine, the diagnosis fee would get credited toward the repair. So he lets me know it would be 2-3 days before I hear from him, after he determines availability of the parts. Great, no problem. Skip ahead *more than three weeks* after I haven't heard anything. I was busy during this time with family, so I gave the benefit of the doubt that they were working on finding the part. During this time, I had many opportunities to get out and shoot, because I was on vacation after the holidays. I felt sad that I wasn't able to do that, because I had no film camera to shoot with. (I don't lug my Canon 5D Mark III and L lenses around for personal photos). 

So early January I call to inquire, wondering at this point what in the world would take three and a half weeks. The man on the phone mumbles something about the tech 'having a hard time with this one' and then asking me a question that made it sound like I was supposed to know what was going on. I said "I don't understand what you are talking about- this is the first time I've spoken to anyone since dropping the camera off over three weeks ago". "Oh, I guess we forgot to call you". Huh. 

I'm a business owner, and if I had discovered a client slipped through the cracks like that, I would have been immediately apologetic and sympathetic, neither of which happened. So the man tells me the repair for the aperture control arm would be $145. I said no, the camera isn't worth it. I could buy a new one of the identical model for around $60 on ebay. I should also add that I had already had the camera looked at by a great repair shop in another city, and they quoted me $90 for the same repair a year ago. So I say "no dice on the repair- I'll come and pick it up". He says "ok, we'll let you know when it's ready". I had to stop him from hanging up. I said "how long will that be? *When* can I pick it up?".  "Ah, maybe 2 or 3 days or so?". 

If I, as a business owner, had a client's product for weeks, after having forgotten about them, when asked when they could pick it up, I would have said this "I'm sorry you fell through the cracks, I'll have my tech get it put back together first thing in the morning. Would tomorrow afternoon work for you to come get it?". I also would have apologized again when they came to pick it up, which he did not do. He just acted like none of it mattered. And I am a very friendly person, very easy to talk to, very reasonable, not difficult at all. I found this whole experience unprofessional, and felt highly unvalued as a customer. (I'm going to note here that it was the same man I dealt with all three times- in person while dropping off, on the phone and at pickup). I'm giving one star because the guy was affable enough when I first when in. And another star for having what appeared to be a very large collection of manual-focus SLR lenses. But I feel that two stars is being generous. Happily I will continue my film photography passion, just with other companies and other stores. It's really unfortunate, as this store is in the area I live in and I had high hopes for them and was excited to patronize a local shop. Oh well, it's worth driving father away for (far) better service.

Review 51: The worst customer service I have ever encountered in a camera shop. I spoke with an older gentle who I believe to be the owner. He was extremely condescending and grumpy. Go to George's on 30th street, you will be treated much better.
1

Review 52: The store has a large variety of used camera equipment and the owner seems nice enough but I'm giving it two stars because I later found out the lens I bought for $189 sold on average for $79 . It's a good enough lens that I'll use it but feel a bit like I was swindled. Perhaps serves me right for not researching on line before the purchase it but I trusted this fellow and now feel that was a mistake. I like to support the local economy and smaller stores over the online big guys but I will likely not be going back here.

Update Nov 8: I added a star as this lens works very well for the purpose it was purchased for and cosmetics-wise it is in excellent condition so, while I do stand by my first review, I felt perhaps I was a bit too harsh with only two stars and unfair as I wrote too soon after discovering the price difference so it was more likely a rant than review.. I will likely be going back here as the owner does know his trade and there is a fantastic selection of vintage photography equipment..

Review 53: Im not one to post reviews...but this treatment could not go  unnoticed. The customer service is extremely poor. The owner is very rude. I have been to this store several times and the service has been about the same. But I decided to give it another try because they have pretty cool things. But I will never go here again after today because  when I asked how much he will give me for my camera he tried to low ball me. So I tried to research in my phone the used resale value, he said everyone tries to look up the prices in their phone but he says I follow this stuff every day with rudeness in his voice. And that's when I said it's time for me to leave..

Review 54: Came in looking for a film camera for a class I am taking. I am very inexperienced with photography and he really helped me out and explained everything i needed and had questions about. I went to George's camera first and bought some of my supplies there, wishing i went her first since the man who worked here is so much nicer than the employee that assisted me at George's. I will definitely come back and buy the things i need here. I'm all about supporting small businesses and glad I found a nice camera store I can go to.

Review 55: I went hear to just simply purchase a battery charger, and the help I got was definitely superior to other shops. It's really a photographers "dreamland." They will definitely be seeing my business again!
5

Review 56: I don't understand how anyone rated this store as 
$$$ , it makes no sense. All prices that I saw were at or below eBay!!! So, you get free advice, excellent service and quality gear at a great price!!! How can that be $$$ ??? I keep coming back for any one of those reasons. I'd rate it as - ¢WISE not $FOOLISH

Review 57: I love walking into this camera shop, it's like going back into time.  Ken knows everything about all the vintage analog photography cameras, lenses and gear.  Nothing beats dropping off your B&amp;W film and getting it back the following morning. You also can't beat having your sensor cleaned by the next day, sometimes even that same day. I like that they will rent just about any camera or lens in the place, and they have all the analog film you might want from polaroid, 35mm and 120.

Review 58: Awesome shop! Big selection of new but mostly used camera gear. The owner us very passionate and frienfly, and literally knows everything about all camera hardware. His prices are gre as t too. Got a nice affordable travel tripod, brand new and in case for 25$. Lenses are pricey, but they are everywhere you go.

Review 59: Love this shop. I like to give all the camera shops in San Diego my business, but I think I may have found my favorite of the bunch. Great service, awesome hard to find items and a huge stick of film, developing supplies and an Insanely fast film processing. I've had nothing but good experiences every time I've walked through their door.

Review 60: The gentleman who helped me was super helpful, funny and patient. 
I highly recommend coming here for camera questions and supplies

Review 61: Love this place for used camera gear, the owner is a pretty nice guy with an absolutely encyclopedic knowledge of camera gear and all things related. You won't save money over going to Craigslist, but you what you get is great, knowledgeable customer service with plenty of VERY clean options that have all been cleaned, lubed and adjusted to factory specs. The gear here is high quality and the employees are helpful. My photography professor in college recommended this place to me and I've passed on the info to anyone looking to get into film or for some high quality used gear here. My friend bought a really F3 and 50mm lens and it shoots great! Thinking I need to upgrade myself soon.... Thanks Camera Exposure! You made me realize how overpriced my local shop is, I happily drive 30 minutes to give you guys my $$.

Review 62: Been in a few times for small needs and was helped by Ken. Nice guy, knows his stuff. Went in today to drop of some film for processing and a gentleman who I've not seen before helped me. He was so charming! (Didn't get a name)

This place has a lot packed into a small space, but some real good buys if you find something. I can't speak for the the pricing on all the old camera and lens gear, because I haven't attempted to buy anything. Doesn't seem like you should go in with too specific expectations on what to find, but it's most certainly fun to browse. Especially on the miscellaneous odds and ends, like bags, lighting gear and lots of other accessories. 

Looking forward to getting my film back, and hopefully I'll continue going back now that I'm jumping back into shooting film. I love that they are only three blocks from my apartment :)

Review 63: Best all-in-one camera shop in San Diego. From expert advice, to hard to find equipment, Camera Exposure can't be beat. They do cleaning, servicing, and processing in house, and have all the professional film selection you'll need. 
I don't go anywhere else.
5

Review 64: I always come here first, to support local and to hear what the owner has to say about my endeavor on upgrading my camera and accessories. Actually, all three cameras and lenses I own, I got from Camera Exposure and I will always come back. 

Very knowledgeable and always eager to help- never had a problem with any of his merchandise.
5

Review 65: Went in only for some accessories. Ken was nice and took his time to show me what he has. I had my equipment with me, so that made it easier! There is a lot to choose from here- it's like stepping into a time machine. I will be back for future endeavors.
4

Review 66: If you're looking for a place to feel judged, this is the place.  You probably don't have enough money to shop here.  

The guy knows more than you, about everything, and he's going to argue / belittle you to prove it.  

He will sell you lenses and filters, but expect you to take them in a paper bag.

Review 67: I recently went in to Purchase a Nikon D5000 
i got a really fair price with a basic package for around 380.
i really like this store they have a lot of used items that are in remarkable condition and unlike almost every camera store in San Diego they sell used like new items at really great prices. My only problem with this store is that the owner was alone all 4 times i went there. he seem overwhelmed and rushed when more than 2 customers showed up while he was busy with me. other than that he really does know about what he sells and buys and always offers a fair price!
4

Review 68: too bad there is not a spot for 0 stars. this place needs to go out of business. i have supported this shop over the years because it is a local business, and i always politely took the hit as the owner blatantly over charged me- typically for $20-$30 over what I would have paid online or elsewhere.
This last time i went in, i bought materials to develop my film. every chemical he sold me was expired, and i asked him specifically for a 120 reel to load my medium format film. he showed me what he had. i told him it looked small, and he assured me it was the right one. of course, once i'm in my light proof bag, i discover he was wrong. 
This is a shope that should not be in business. it is a great and romantic idea, but it is run by a jerk who sells you worthless things for 2x what you can pay for stuff elsewhere.

Review 69: 1. first time i went i had bought most of everything for a darkroom from a photographer who had gone all digital.  I went to go check out the stuff at camera exposure to see if they had any clips, and other small things to complete everything (I got everything for about $100 off of c-list and the photographer had never taken the time out to remove the stickers with the original prices). So when i went to Camera Exposure I asked how much the timers cost, well, they cost the same as they did new.  over 30 years ago.  Everything was like that.

2. i went to go look for an enlarger lens, I switched to medium format so i needed a 100mm enlarger lens.  They had a HAZY Schneider 100mm/105mm (don't remember which) for $236 dollars.  This same lens sells on ebay (brand new, never used) for $100.  WTF. 

3. The same time i went for an enlarger lens i went to ask for a waist level finder for a Mamiya RB67. I'd seen the prices on ebay for around $35 - $100 max.  He shows me one and says it's $125 dollars, it's in decent condition but not minty.  Online i could buy the whole camera with a waist level finder for $145 dollars!!!

the guy is rude, he speaks as if he's the final word on anything.  Honesty, i'm not going back.  His prices are 2 x or more what they go for anywhere, he commands the prices as if they are in mint condition, or antiques whose value have gone up (of which neither is the case).  I'm surprised the guy is in business, but I guess if you don't search around, you won't know your getting scammed.  Never brought myself to give him any of my money, and i won't... sorry dude, but with that attitude, and those prices, i'd rather just not have this place around... i'm skipping this place from now on.

Review 71: Terrible, terrible customer service. I work with clients everyday at my job, and I have never treated a client like an idiot because I value my customers. You see how that works? If the guy who works here had a better attitude, he would probably not have a 2-3 star rating on Yelp and Google too.

Ignoring their terrible ratings, I decided to ring them up.

I began explaining what kind of lens I was looking for to the salesman, giving him an example of a lens I had read up on and played about with--Canon 85mm f1.8. "You want a fast prime lens," he replied. I agreed saying I was a beginner of sorts who was looking for a "high aperture."

This is when the problem began. The salesman began to get defensive and angry at me for misusing the word "high" and lectured me on the difference between high and low aperture. Ok. I messed up on my wording. Sorry. We both knew what I meant when I mentioned f1.8. But, no, he kept going and going and going. When he mentioned that a 50mm on my camera would be like an 80mm, I said, "Ok, so the 50 on my camera is similar to the 85?" His reply? "More like 82 or an 83."--in the most demeaning voice possible.

Oooookay. I get it dude, you know cameras. Photography is your thing. Awesome.

I decided to be patient and asked him how much he was selling his USED Canon 50mm f1.4 for. He told me mid-300s. 

So basically I sat and listened to this demeaning jerk for ten minutes only to find out that he is selling a used lens for about $30 less than I can buy it new. And $50 more than it's price on Craigslist....

 "It looks new," he threw in at the end.

You're a tool.

You know, I actually had a great phone call yesterday with the owner of Bill's Camera and Photo Lab in Huntington Beach. He neither talked down to me nor tried to make me feel dumb. He just helped me. In hindsight, that call was amazing, because apparently on the other end of amazing is Camera Exposure: Your one-stop shop for a bad mood and a rip-off! Hooray!
1

Review 72: I walked in the other day for the first time with high hopes and anticipation but I was quickly let down by the customer service. 

First of all, its a small shop, everything is compressed/jampacked and little room to walk in. No biggie. 

My eyes were just wondering all over the room majestically looking at film cameras, digital cameras, tripods, stands, lights, lenses, filters.....etc, you get the picture. But, the owner was just polishing something and not once did he even look up at me and said hi or asked if I needed any help or anything. I literally was in there for ten minutes and he didn't even acknowledge my presence. 

Also, I did notice on many of his accessories he carries are relatively pricier than other places or online. However, I did find a few things at good prices. But, why would I want to step in here again if he doesn't even acknowledge prospective customers.

Review 73: I've been trying to call this place to get a quote on a routine system check and sensor cleaning but no one ever picks up.
1

Review 74: I was very unimpressed. Went in to establish a business relationship, and the guy told me right off that my camera would cost $100 to repair it. I already had done my homework, and found he was untruthful. He didn't know the difference between a Yashica Mat-24 and the 24G, and even after I told him he shrugged. He also cut down a repair shop on Mission Gorge stating "guy charges too much." I'd already met the competitor, and heard on the street how nice he is. This one lost all my trust, and now I will go to the guy he put down because he deserves my business more, and has a stellar reputation. Go Kurt!

Review 75: i don't really want to visit this place due to the phone conversation that i had with them.  thanks to Chelsea P. for her review and i am also taking my son to visit a different store.   If you ever need advise from anyone over the phone you defiantly need to call calumet!!!!  they are extremely helpful every time and don't try to rip you off.

Review 76: The shop isn't perfect, but if you're looking for used camera gear the pickings are slim in San Diego. 

The good: he has a lot of stuff, is a knowledgable repairman, and you can find some good deals here if you know your equipment. Everything he sells has a 30 day warranty, and he's fixed a couple of things I'd bought there that seemed to be broken, but just needed some small repairs. Another item I bought there that would up having some problems he swapped out for another one. I've also gotten some great deals on lenses here, paying less than I've seen many go for on eBay.

The bad: his pricing is haphazard. I've seen accusations on Yelp of gouging, and while I have bought things there that were too expensive upon further research, I don't think it's deliberate on his part. I think he prices items when they come in, and then doesn't update them later.

I think the best way to put it is that there are some things that are worth buying here over something like eBay. Camera bodies, in particular, since he guarantees those and can fix them if there's a problem. Accessories and lenses, do your research first.
3

Review 77: You can't tell me how much something is over the phone? Sorry, but I'm a mom of two toddlers and frankly don't have the time to drag them around town and come to the store to find out how much something is. I want the best deal I can find. So I do the necessary research from home before I decide to drive out and buy. That's really too bad, even if you do have the best deal for what I'm looking for. You really should consider changing that policy...

Review 78: Great little camera shop! Wonderful selection of used lenses, I was actually referred to this place by two other nearby camera stores! I found this place first, but decided to ask around for the best selection of used lenses. The other stores all recommended I come here, so I did.

The salesman present was very nice, and very patient. He let me try on a bunch of lenses for my Nikon D3100, and the prices were not too bad! My girlfriend was also very patient, kudos to them both, I was looking for 
"that perfect lens" to be my new walk around, and I'm very picky. I finally settled on a 24-135 f/3.5-5.6. Okay, so it's not the perfect lens, but it is great for most of my shots. Lens and good UV filter totaled $260. I almost bought the 35-70, but it just wasn't versatile enough... But it was like $100 cheaper... Lol

All in all, I will DEFINITELY be returning here, next time I am in town. (I'm from NY, hehe).

Oh, and as a side note, that photo up there is black and white. The awning is actually green. Don't miss it!

Review 79: I live in the neighborhood and went to this shop to have my Canon XTi repaired. The hot shoe had become loose causing my external flash to lose contact and not fire. I was told that there would be a $35 fee to examine the camera, but that it would be applied to the final repair.  I asked what the possible range in cost could be and was told he couldn't say until he had the camera apart.  I decide to try another nearby shop, who sent me to a third shop as they don't do on site repairs.  The third shop fixed the camera in ten minutes while I waited and charged only $12.50 Needless to say I won''t be back to Camera Exposure.
1

Review 80: I've only been here once, but you know, they fixed my FE2's busted film crank in 10mins for $10!  Thank you, here's your 4 stars to go with your good karma.  In a digital world, I thought I'd have to scour the ends of the globe (or Santee) for such a service.  How lucky am I to live just a neighborhood away?!

In addition to fixing stuff, they sell stuff, too- lots of it, mostly for darkrooms and studios.  The shop is a little like walking into an episode of "Hoarders," but if there's any place worth being knee-deep in crap for, it's a photography supply store.  There's enough darkroom things, tripods, strobes, enlargers, and film cameras (is that a near mint SX-70?!!) to keep you nerding out for days.  Yes, you might find a better deal online (*note: <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FKEH.com&amp;s=c3aac29525133d19947a892dd2c3a7f3d9bcc30444f5cac6a33fac08d2d60db9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KEH.com</a>), but the point here is convenience (if you live in the area) and getting help from a sentient being who's telling you what's what about your purchase. And the price difference is really comparable if you figure in the shipping price from a reputable re-seller with a reliable rating system (*plug: <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FKEH.com&amp;s=c3aac29525133d19947a892dd2c3a7f3d9bcc30444f5cac6a33fac08d2d60db9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KEH.com</a>).  

Their hours of operation are..  kind of a guessing game.  Just the fact that they're still in business was a surprise!  I was told M-F: 1-5pm, Sa: 9-4p, but there's been evidence to the contrary reported by some of my photo buddies.  I guess call first, that's always a good rule, right?

I'm going back soon to see about a corroded cable release hole, and to take my friend's niece shopping for a solid, vintage, starter Nikon.  What's nice is that I can check both of those off here without the worry and exasperation of first, finding a place that meets not just one but both needs, and then getting questionable service in the end.  (We made the mistake of going to Kobe's to see shady camera guy to see if he could be of any help..  Shady camera guy is shady, kids! Couldn't point out the ISO dial for the things he sold!  But that's a whole nother review..)  Camera Exp is worth checking out for a lot of different reasons, getting your camera fix(ed) being chief among them.

Review 81: The guys are relatively knowledgeable, though nothing special in the realm of old-school photo stores. I'm from Columbus, so I'm used to MPEX (Midwest Photo Exchange) and Columbus Camera Group, probably two of the best known used gear dealers in the nation, so I guess I'm spoiled. 

The prices are really, really high on old stuff. A Paterson reel shouldn't be $5, you can pick them up every day on Craigslist for $1 or $2. I bought two used gallon jugs and they charged me $4 freaking dollars for them. Read that again, two used chemical containers that were dirty and had labels on them. I needed the jugs that day, though, and I didn't want to cause a fuss. That's the kind of thing that makes me not want to go back, though. I can understand charging more for reels or something, but charging me that much for what is essentially garbage is insulting. My fault for paying for it.

The "student kits" here are, again, insanely overpriced. $200-300 for Pentax K1000s and Olympus OMs? Get a Nikon N80 on eBay for essentially free (less than $50). Want to go all manual? Get a Minolta SRT and use the ridiculously cheap Minolta Rokkor lenses. I bought my Nikon F4s locally for cheaper than their cheapest student kits.

They also don't really have any chemicals left for black and white developing. Nelson's actually has a more comprehensive black and white department. I don't really see any reason to go here (not that you could, since they're open about 8 hours a week).

Review 82: I just bought a 35mm camera here and I am pretty happy with it. 

My photography professor recommended this place so I knew it was legit. He stressed that they were very helpful here, not to mention it's the only place in San Diego where you can find good quality cameras from  the completely manual variety to the newer digital ones. They had everything from Nikon to Canon to Minolta.

The guys here were very helpful and answered the multitude of questions that my mother and I had....mostly from my mom. They even worked around the fact that my mom does not like Vivitar at all haha

I ended up buying a Konica with a standard lens, a zoom lens, 28mm lens, camera strap, 2 rolls of film and camera backpack for about $300
The guy also said I could come in with any questions I had and they guarantee it for a while since they make sure they all work before they sell them. Plus they are open for any repairs and I lot of other services you might need.

I didn't think was bad at all for everything I got and my mom, well, she was just happy it wasn't a Vivitar.
4

Review 83: They closed awhile back, and have no reopened with new ownership.  Everything seems the same to me.  There are some really nice vintage cameras here, and other photo supplies at decent prices that balance out with all the expensive stuff. 

Camera Exposure has odd hours, and is never open when you want it to be.
3

Review 84: Avoid! Went there only once to offer some lenses and camera bodies left to me by my father that had recently passed away. Probably about $2000 worth (some were new EOS lenses, L quality, and a 1Ds camera body, unused) if sold individually. 

Came on a busy day, but I waited patiently for at least an hour before being helped. No one acknowledged the long wait or said they would be with me soon. Ok, busy, I was patient.

Finally got some help, --literally-- waited another hour (standing at the counter) waiting for the gentleman to get me a quote price for all the lenses. Had to ask other employees twice if he had forgotten about me because I did not see him at all while waiting.

The worst-- his offer? About $300 dollars total. I understand he has to make a profit in selling the stuff later, but come on! I walked out believing that he thought I was an amateur and that he was trying to rip me off. 

A terrible experience. Will never go back. Sold one of the lenses a few days later on Craig's List for $300 alone.

Review for Walmart Photo Center:
Review 1: AWFUL!!! Do not rely on them!! I did 20 photos for 1 hour photo, I needed them the next day for a project that had a next day deadline. I received the email saying the photos were ready for pickup but when I went in to get them....they were LOST!! These people were struggling, I'm not convinced they are competent to be even be working!! Needless to say,  the photos could NOT be found, they LOST them!! How does that happen??? No apology, no explanation, just sorry we can't find them!! NEXT!
1

Review 2: Walmart did a terrible job with my photos. ALL of my photos were cut off and they didnt print my photos identical as originally approved on my walmart account. I always review my photos to make sure all the angles are proper and the Walmart workers still mess up. Waste of money and they fail to reprint your photos for their big mess up. They are scammers. Don't waste your time getting your photos developed here unless you don't care to be scammed by them. Highly not recommended

Review 3: Ordered a poster here, tried to pick it up at the Southgate location here in Southern California.  The poster was damaged at the top.  I waited a long 2 weeks for nothing

Review 4: I am not happy, Im in canada, Amherstburg Ontario, I ordered a few posters, I sell posters and thought I wold get some samples to see if it Walmart was a viable business option, turns out ,  no way.
I dont have my posters I was told max time 72 hours , over a week ago and not communication, I went in yesterday after ringing the phone no one answered, the woman had no clue , went in again in the evening. apt they have no ink and have no idea when they will have ink and that was it, that was the level of proffesional ability , so order , dont get the order, no communication and too bad is the final answer, so hell no will not put m business thru here , I doubt I will even get the  5 posters I ordered
1

Review 5: My one hour order turned into 5 days of calls and aggravation. They lack communication  and have no regard for Customer Svc. Their  promises to call or text as to  order status went unfulfilled. Finally I drove to store where there was no one at the desk. Three employees finally materialized from no where. I Was Able to get a refund.  They had no idea when my order could be done.  Apparently their machine was down and they were asking each other if it was called in for repair (?) No one seemed to know what was going on. So much for one hour photos .
I gave Walmart a second chance by placing an order at a different store. Things got worse - they never completed my order either.  However, they texted saying my order WAS completed . I traveled in the rain to pick it up, only to discover their machine has been down for 2 weeks.  I'm angry about the lack of communication &amp; professionalism.
  Finally, I sent my order to Walgreens - they emailed when they received the order and again when completed. it was ready in an hour and everything was perfect.

Review 6: Never use Walmart Photo, in-store or online. They are useless. In-store is never an hour. Simply lies. Online they'll take your payment immediately and simply not deliver your photos. Thieves. This year I tried again online, as they had a holiday card format I liked. Same result as the attempt a few years ago: they took my money, stated a delivery date, and the cards never arrived. When the delivery date passed the status simply remained "in process". I contacted customer service via chat, and they stated that for me to get my holiday cards they would need to get it "unstuck" by cancelling the order and re-ordering. So, basically, they were happy to take my money and not delivery the product. If I had not contacted them that would have remained the status forever. Seriously. Never use Walmart for anything.

Review 7: Terrible, horrible, Never at all ever! 
This is our opinion with Walmart Photo studio @ their shops. I will explain why! We decided to have a photo shoot on a very special occasion in our life,thus booked n appointment at the Walmart studio(They have smilies savers program: doesn't save anything though!)We dressed up in our traditional outfits, were on time, there was a session prior to us that got extended into ours by more than half hour, that's ok , happens we thought. Now our turn excited! It was not our first time ,usually we do these sessions about once a year as a family.
Realised this photographer was a trainee with no portrait experience at all. Her suggestions were proving worse than ours. There was a senior photographer who denied to even tweak or suggest good poses. That was kind of rude start after waiting about an hour of no successful posses. When our shoot was done we had to choose our photos, their system is absolute suitable for stone age! uploading took another 1 hour.Not a joke I will highly recommend u go and try out if u feel I am lying. Further to that we did NOT pass any photos as the looks were horrible/ poses seemed as if robots etc! Thus she offered to take one more hour and session again. Luckily there was no appointment after us for another hour.Then everything all over again , where we made all the suggestions only and asked her to shoot. much better out come and we picked 5 poses paid about $ 100(as studio fee, had a cupoon) and waited it to upload to our account ,another 45 mins then choise another half hour. there was an appointment waiting after us now almost for 45 mins , I feel bad for them. It took us 4 hours , I almost passed out with out food or water since I though it would take 2 hours ! anyways that's not the real fun...fun starts now .we were handed in a sheet with our account number and PW. rest is online process the studio responsibility ENDED at this point. Online seems a very easy process how ever IT ABSOLUTELY IS not . I WOULD RATHER PREFER to pick up READY pictures whenever they are ready. cos the online HAZZSLE WE HAVE TO FIGUREIT OUT !! that is time consuming which I PERSONALLY WILL NEVER PREFER. iTS NOT THAT I AM NOT TECH SAVY I work with IT for work.It took me to juggle with the call center, photo centre and print machine at Walmart . 
additional about one whole week of running around and calling call centre for online help .Final word : photo studio is only responsible for shooting the photos NOTHING ELSE AT ALL. PRINTING PHOTOS ARE ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR PRINTING NOTING ELSE AT ALL , CALL CENTRE IS ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ONLINE HELP . they are not at all tied or connected to help CUSTOMERs in anyway. If u have lots of time and patience go check it out . I will never

Review 8: I had a terrible experience at Walmart Bellingham, MA. I ordered a mounted print. The lady at the photo center gave it to me and walked away. When I opened the package, I found that the photo was not cut and it extended the block by about 1/8 inch. I waited for the lady to return. She tried to cut it with an xacto knife and the edges were crooked. She tried it three times and told me that's the best she could do. I took it as i needed it badly, but every time I look at the mounted photo, the edges look ugly. I will not buy mounted photos from Walmart. They dont know how to cut photos.

Review 9: I am very disappointed to photo center in Clairemont Branch. I waited for 1 hour to our wedding album, and there's a missing one. So they re print it. They told me to wait for 3 minutes, but it's 1 hour already. I asked them where os 1 photo? And the staff told me, out of paper and after 15 mins he says the machine is not working well. What the heck? My family is waiting for me for total of 3 hours ! My poor baby wants to sleep but we need to wait for it. They didn't finished my album. So I'll let go and not accept it. It's just a waste of time.

Review 10: Just one guy that's aggravating as heck. He's very knowledgeable but feels like talking down to clients is appropriate. 
He on this day said "Sorry you payed extra for your pictures to be ready now. It's not ready come back later, maybe 20 minutes".
Us - ... We want the extra charge taken off because it's not ready.
Him - "Nothing I can do about it"

In my opinion, give me the extra money payed for getting pictures printed emidiatly and charge us for 1 hr print. It's not that hard to be polite. And saying "Ya brother, not my problem" helps no one.
Avoid this guy if possible (at all cost).
In addition I had left some old film (found while cleaning my parents place). After a week I went in to check if pics were ready. Same guy says (without checking to see if pictures were processed) did we call you to say they are ready"? I replied "No". He told me not to come back until I received a call. I came back after he left the area and asked someone else to check and sure enough the processed prints were there.

Review 11: 9 out of 10 times I go to this Walmart. I went about two weeks ago, planning on buying gum I would pick up at the register as usual, they were all out of any kind of gum, empty at all registers, I went back today and the same thing!  what happened to the gum?? WT

Review 12: This is my usual Walmart and out of all of the Walmart stores I've been to in the past one person stood out with excellent customer service. Her name is SLOBODANKA. I went into Walmart looking for a Dog Car Seat Cover and I couldn't find it. She took the time out to look on the phone inventory to see if it was there and walked me to the isle. No Walmart employee has ever stopped what they were doing to help me. 

She as very helpful and displayed great customer service and she was very friendly. Also very upbeat with a smile. A few other customers stopped her and asked questions while she was helping me and she multitasked her duties perfectly. 

Better than any Walmart employee I've ever seen. I would have to say she's the best and for once Walmart actually hired a great employee. This Walmart isn't a bad place I just normally use Walmart for quick emergency stops. I will continue to visit this location.

Review 13: Horrible customer service. Got my pictures from the associate, opened them and noticed lines so immediately gave them back. She "cleaned" machine and reprinted and still lines. She lost my receipt and said I never gave it back to her and tried to give me a gift card back. Then I asked if she checked everyone else's prints and she said yes and mine were the only ones with lines yet she pulled out a magnifying glass to read my drivers license. I edit my photos in photoshop so I know for a fact the lines are from the printer. 

CHECK YOUR PHOTOS BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE STORE!!

Review 14: Although getting into Walmart is pretty much always hectic unless you are going at midnight and even then there's probably a line of about 10 people in front of you. The photo centers has great deals and I feel like they offer a variety of items that you can add on to your pictures. The prices are mediocre to competitive with other companies. I do like that they have a video and VHS/Beta Max conversion. These are old movies on tape for the younger croud... not a film reel... a few after that. Haha Its a bit expensive, but surprisingly cheaper than Costco.

Review 16: Walmart is a store folks love to hate. One of the good things about Walmart is the low prices. One bad thing is thier low prices tend to force the mom and pop stores out of business.one good thing  about Walmart is the wide varity of items they stock. One bad thing about Walmart  is because they stock a wide varity of items many times its impossible to navigate around the boxes to the items  ypu are looking for. One of the good things about Walmart is that they allow folks to camp in the parking lot over night.One bad thing is they allow folks to camp out in the parking lot this could be a potential hazzard for customers. One of the good things about Walmart is they sell alcohol one bad thing about  Walmart is they sell alcohol. If the campers consume too much alcohol it would be potentially hazzardous to customers. I shudder to think of the potential danger caused by a drunk camper that get behind the wheel of a large camper. I Could go on and on but what would be the point. 1:45 AM. I should have been asleep 3 hours ago.

Review 17: I was disappointed with the 1 hour photo, this is where you purchase Vudu movies. The gentleman at the counter was filling in and was not knowledgeable about Vudu or the service. He did however state the computer was down and has been for the past month. 

From my understanding Walmart is the parent company of Vudu therefore I find this service or lack of unacceptable. Why have signs as soon as you enter the store promoting a service that is unavailable.

Review 18: Reviewing the 1-Hour Photo Center. I ordered my items online. Normally, I don't shop at this location however the photo printing machine was out of service at the other Wal-Mart that I usually frequent. 

I received my text message that my online photos were ready for pick up. I went to the photo department and there was no one at the counter. There was a sign that said if you needed assistance to see someone in the Electronics Department. I walked over to Electronics and there was adequate staff there, however the staff was busy with people buying cell phones and one operating the cash register. I waited in the line for the cashier...I am being nice and waiting patiently, however the few people who were ahead of me were all buying electronics that the cashier was trying to upsell insurance to for their products and the whole nine yards. 

Seeing the line go nowhere quick, I decided to walk back to the Photo Department in the hopes that the person who was supposed to be covering the photo department  would be back at the counter. YAY ME! There was someone there. Got my items and zipped out of the store. 

Ordering online = painless and inexpensive. Time spent in the store = cost a bunch of my time.

Review 19: I have been here a few times. This is the closest Walmart to my house. Prices are same, customer service us not that good, store is not that clean too

Review 20: This Walmart is very open and spacious which is a plus, but they don't have a deli mart for fresh cut lunch meats. This is not a Walmart Super Center in my opinion. 

But the place is clean and the staff are readily available.

Review for Total Photo:
Review 1: Friendly, quick, and professional! I had two rolls of 35 mm film developed and was also sent digital scans. The entire process was simple with their COVID protocol. I dropped off my film at their door and provided my contact information. The next day I received an invoice electronically, followed by my digital/physical copies. I've developed photos elsewhere in San Diego and they have the fastest turnaround time. 10th roll developed is free! Will definitely return in the future.

Review 2: I had an issue with the quality of my photos I had downloaded and Christina was incredibly kind and found my old film, examined it and found the issue (which was that the actual film I turned in was exposed to sun/damaged, and it wasn't my computer that was downloading it poorly). She offered to give me a refund and was very patient with me over the phone. I would recommend Total Photo to everyone and their service is obviously great- I just wish I didn't turn in crap film. Thank you Total Photo!

Review 6: This place is such a gem! I have lived around the world and honestly this is literally THE BEST place for developing film.

Review 7: My wife and I have had numerous photos enlarged and printed at Total Photo. They have also created and bound travel photo albums for us. Their work is always excellent. I recently ordered two puzzles made from photographs, and could not be happier with the results! Christina and Tom are very easy to communicate and work with, and I highly recommend them.

Review 8: was having problems getting my cartridge out of my camera and they were able to fix it free of charge. one of the few places that develop 110mm film in san diego still, rates are super reasonable

Review 9: Christina is an absolute sweetheart! I bring my film here to get developed every week or two and they are always consistent with their customer service, turn around time and the quality of processing. Prices are more than fair and they have a loyalty punch card now as well! Definitely recommend for any of your film or printing needs.

Review 10: I couldn't have asked for a more professional, incredibly friendly,intuitive and caring couple to make a better video for our son's wedding reception.  They made a wonderful memory keepsake for our families...we recommend them and thank them from the bottom of our hearts.

Review 11: I love this place... Family owned and I always get high-quality pictures very quickly with reasonable pricing. Not to mention the owners go over and beyond to provide exceptional service.

Review 13: Tom and Christina at Total Photo are superb.  We've used their very professional services for multiple birthday/anniversary party posters and enlarged photos for a celebration of life.  Tom has also cropped and improve the quality of my photos.  We appreciate their fast turn-around time.  They also sell a unique photo 'block' (wood and acrylic) that I've given as gifts - and the recipients love them!  Glad to support this local business!

Review 14: Christina was amazing in helping me get enlarged photos of my Father for his memorial service, same day.  I had been out of town the previous week and was leaving the next day to be in attendance of said memorial and I completely forgot about the enlargement that I needed.  Well, Christina came to the rescue and was super helpful in getting me what I needed in short order.  Thanks again Total Photo for your help!

Review 15: I have been come to this photo shop for years and it is amazing - Great personal service and expert work!!!Whether printing digital or from film or transferring tapes to DVDs or MP4 files, the quality is superior!!!  They offer metal and bamboo prints, photo books and have a huge variety of services. You'll never be disappointed!

Review 16: Owner Christina was so helpful, professional and pleasant in helping us acquire specific-sized passport photos for China visa.  Highly recommend Total Photo for passport photos and all your photo needs.

Review 17: To me, As a striving photographer artist, The quality of the print is so important that going with anything of than top quality is a waste of time and money. I am extremely pleased with the results I get working with Total Photo, on a person to person level when ordering and the end result of the print that I not only use them I also always recommend them to all my fellow photographers. So if quality is a must, like it is for me, this place is the best!

Review 19: We are so lucky to have this store in our area! I have been developing film for my photography here and will never go anywhere else. The store owners are amazing people that really care about their customers!! They have treated me like family. They do amazing work and are very fast. I have learned a lot about photography from them and could not be more happy. I am so happy I found this place and highly recommend it to anyone.

Review 20: I got my Canadian passport photo done here. Service was very fast and quick and friendly. In fact the woman helping me even knew the Canadian passport photo requirements without me even telling her. She said that they probably do as many Canadian passport photos as they do American. I was in and out in about 10 minutes. I just received my Canadian passport from FedEx as well. Obviously there were no problems from the Canadian government's point of view.
Fast, friendly service along with a perfect passport photo, what's there not to like?
5

Review 21: I got my Canadian passport photo taken here a few weeks ago. It was a pretty basic process where you stand against a white wall and they use a special camera (no cheapo point and shoot) which allows them to take passport photos to specification. The whole thing took less than 10 minutes. I think this place may be a little pricier than most (check prices on their website) but it was worth it because my application didn't get rejected. I received my passport in the mail last week and the photo looks decent.

Review 22: I came here for my Canadian passport photo. I wear glasses and everywhere I got they ask me to take off to prevent glare. For me I want my passport photo to have my glasses so I don't have to take them off every time I'm at airport custom. They were ok with me not taking off my glasses. In the end, my photos were accepted and I got my passport. Satisfied!

Review 23: These guys are great. Not only do they take quick foreign passport photos, but also know the difference in sizes between countries.  They even corrected me when I needed a difference size for citizenship application vs. passport.  Great people, knowledgeable and a fair price.

Review 24: I came in today to get my Canadian passport photo taken. The holiday hours are posted on their website, which is excellent, because it really sucks when businesses don't update that! I also messaged them using Yelp and got a prompt response. 

The photo took literally 2 seconds- just the way I like it. You can't smile in a Canadian passport photo, so of course I looked scary as all hell, but Christina was able to take another photo to compare the two. That was really awesome of her. She was also super friendly and very approachable.

My photo ended up having some glare (sorry moisturizer + highlighter) - I totally forgot about that! I think the gentleman in the back room was Tom, and he was able to take away the glare without the photo looking even more stupid as my face did in it! They are super friendly and professional.

I would highly recommend them if you need any photos, or passports. The price was around $21 with some change which is fine to me. I expect a price like that anywhere. Now I shall pray that it doesn't get rejected (they have a winning streak on no rejections)! 

Thank you so much!

Review 25: We are so pleased with the work we requested at Total Photo in Solana Beach by Carls' Jr.
Wonderful customer service and right before Christmas.  
We special ordered a canvas of a photo that was 30 years old with writing on it.  They were able to scan the photo and remove the unwanted writing.
Amazing job!  
We are thrilled

Review 26: Poor customer service.  The owners are actually the culprit!  They hire friendly staff but on my last (now final) visit I was left to work with them.  The female owner is an ice princess--not friendly and actually condescending!  I live close by, but no need to put up with poor service and attitude when there are friendly and expert comprable businesses in the area.  Her demeanor so bad I walked out! I took my business to Encinitas Photo Center and they were awesome!!.   They were friendly and I relied on their expertise and advice and the results were perfect!

Review 27: My son had to renew his Canadian passport recently. This is the 2nd time we have used Total Photo. My son has just received his new passport which was processed in less than 2 weeks.
Thanks Total Photo.

Review 28: This place is all about the service and quality.  Tom will come through every time.  Again, for the SD Fair Photo contest, I was racing around, and he remained calm and did everything I needed and more. he spends time working with you on size and color so your print will come out just how you want it. I can always rely on Total Photo to do everything that needs to be done in a timely manner.

Review 29: We have used Tom and Total Photo a couple of time for visa and Green Card passports photos etc. Always easy and efficient and friendly local service. We are fans

Review 30: I needed my Canadian passport photo.  They new exactly what was needed.  Effecient friendly service.  I was in and out in 10min.

Review 31: I needed Canadian passport photos for my 2 year old daughter. I phoned beforehand to make sure that they are OK with a toddler. Having confirmed that it is not a problem, we showed up. The person took the pictures then cut it to the Canadian specifications. 

I sent the old passport, application form and photo off to Canada with Fedex, a $35.00 expense.

It was returned to me in about 10 days, as the photo was unacceptable as the background had the chair in it. The white background screen does not reach low enough and my daughter had to stand on a chair. The backrest of the chair showed up on the picture!

Clearly they never photographed a toddler before and their only interest was to get me there! Obviously the high price ($18.00) reflects their incompetence and not their knowledge.

I had to go back (15 miles drive each way and about 30 minutes) to get my money back. I took the photos with me and my money was refunded.

If there was such a thing as a zero rating, that is what I would give. They are expensive and do not even do the job properly!
