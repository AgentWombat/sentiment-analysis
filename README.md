# sentiment-analysis

➢ Goal: Develop a model to predict the star rating of a
review based on the text within the review.
➢ Stretch 1: Generalize the model to predict whether a piece
of text is speaking positively or negatively about a
subject.
➢ Stretch 2: Develop a web browser extension which can
identify a body of text as either positively or negatively
referencing a subject.

➢ Python and some libraries/modules:
  ○ “Requests” for data collection.
  ○ “Tensorflow” for machine learning.
➢ For Stretch 2, Javascript would be a likely candidate for
extension development. Tensorflow has a Javascript library
in addition to its Python library; so, any model which we
develop in Python could be loaded into Javascript code.
