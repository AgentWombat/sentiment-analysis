[{"text": "I love my ps5. As an Xbox gamer who's been watching Sony's first part game lineup explode since ps3 days, my curiosity grew into a need. I needed to play the last of us 1 and 2, bloodborne, god of war, uncharted, ff7 remake, ghost of tsushima, and countless others, and I couldn't settle for a new console that was less powerful than my one X is. I had to go big or wait, and after over a decade of waiting, I saw the price and jumped on this sale instantly. I'm overjoyed with my purchase, and I make pretty decent money so I figured I'd throw some of that stimulus check money at it, and I regret nothing. At all. This console is DOPE, and I live it more than any Xbox I've ever owned since the original Xbox. Now I have Xbox, Nintendo switch, and ps5 all sitting next to each other and I'll never miss another exclusive release again. I'm also very happy with the speed in which it was delivered. It took under a week, and this console runs quiet. It's louder than the switch, but quieter than my one X. I'll hear it rev up once in a while, but it only lasts a few seconds before it's silent again for hours on end. Games load FAST. I'm talking no longer than 6 seconds, even for both spider man games, and the last of us 2. And the upscaling and enhanced features are mine blowingly awesome! The adaptive triggers on the controllers make it feel like you're actually pulling real triggers. They lock up about half way through a trigger pull, and you have to use a little extra force to pull em all the way back, coupled with perfect timed vibration, and sound coming from the controller, it's a thing of pure beauty to feel in your hands. It's literally like shooting a gun. The track pad is flawless for doodling in whatever games you draw on it with, and just holding that controller, you know it's built for quality. If only the D pad and sticks were in easier to access spots like the Xbox and Nintendo pro controllers are, I would've easily given this controller 10/10. It's an easy 9/10 though. The rest of the console is amazing though. Best console I've ever owned. I'm ecstatic every time I turn it on. Read full review...", "rating": "5"}, {"text": "It definitely runs better than the PlayStation 4, and doesn't sound like a jet engine the way the PS4 did. Graphics are better, the adaptive triggers are a nice feature. I have to say I like the UI better on the PlayStation 4 as the PS5's is sometimes difficult to navigate. There are a lot of awesome features though, like picking right back up where you left off after the system enters rest mode. My only real complaint is the huge lack of system storage and capabilities to upgrade the storage. I can fit maybe 7 games at a time on the console at most. System needs upgraded SSD capability. On the PS4 I never had an issue with storage management thanks to my 6 TB hardrive upgrade. 4/5, would be 5/5 with upgraded storage capability.

But overall the system isn\u2019t that bad for the $500 price tag. Would say there\u2019s a lot of room for improvement with their saves, buggy UI, and no extra storage of the console... but overall for the couple of games that I wanted to play exclusively on PS5 it\u2019s been great. Wouldn\u2019t pay scalper price.Read full review...", "rating": "5"}, {"text": "The PS5 is so much faster than the 4, the graphics are a big leap forward, the speed of loading and server-based games is much faster, and the n\u00e9e controller is the best controller I\u2019ve ever used.

They have moved a lot of things around from where they were on the PS4, so a little learning is required to get used to it, but it's generally no issue.

At launch it will be available with an advanced haptic feedback controller thats battery life will be anywhere from 3 hours to 10 depending on its usage. The PS5 uses an advanced cooling solution involving Liquid Metal and Evaporation Chambers. A combined technique that will create a quiet gaming experience. On launch there will be a few games, however the PS5 is backwards compatible and will run most games from previous generations. The Disc version comes with a blue-ray player and will run disc versions of games unless they require software downloads like most high capacity games demand nowadays.

Admittedly, I overpaid which is why I answered \"no\" to the question of \"Is it a good value?\" However, I willingly overpaid because I didn't want to give my son an \"IOU\" for Christmas.
